<h3><a id="ABGeneral Abilities">General abilities:</a></h3>

+ **Maleficium:**
Raid-wide AoE dealing <span class="magic">magical damage</span>.

+ **Rapturous Reach:**
*Eden's Promise* will either cleave its left or right, dealing <span class="phys">physical damage</span> and applying a <span class="debuff">Damage Down</span> debuff. Careful, the cleave isn't a 180° but a 200° cleave.

+ **Formless judgement:**
Two tank buster on both the main target and the second player in the aggro list. Targets for the first attacks are acquired and set when the cast begins, targets for the second attacks are set when the cast is over.

    + *Eden's Promise* attacks on the main target will do slash damage, dealing <span class="phys">physical damage</span> and applying a <span class="debuff">Slashing Resistance Down</span> debuff.  
    + *Eden's Promise* attacks on the second target will do pierce damage, dealing <span class="phys">physical damage</span> and applying a <span class="debuff">Piercing Resistance Down</span> debuff.

+ **Paradise Lost:**
Enrage.
