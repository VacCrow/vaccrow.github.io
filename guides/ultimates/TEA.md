*Liquid Hand* will glow and change:
	+ into a closed fist shape (fist-bump like), if he's close to *Living Liquid*.  
	*Liquid Hand* needs to pulled away from the boss before he insta-cast **Hand of Prayer**. If they're far enough from each other, it will deal small <span class="magic">magical damage</span> otherwise the group will wipe.

	+ into an open hand shape (high-five like) if he's far from *Living Liquid*.

<h2>Strategy</h2>

The Easiest Limit Cut:
After the first explosion, one group (with numbers 1, 2, 5 and 6) go to the North or East, and the other group (3, 4, 7 and 8) go South or West.
Everyone follows the AoEs. For each group, the next duo to be attacked runs in the inner ring and the other duo runs in the outer ring. Odd numbered players face the next AoE in front of him to not cleave anyone and the even numbered player faces his duo mate.
Once a duo is hit, swap your ring position with the other duo.
Rinse and repeat
(You can stop moving after the 3rd AoE of the second set)

<h2><a id="Brute Justice & Cruise ChaserStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

After **Limit Cut**, regroup mid and heal for the incoming **J-Kick** followed by **Whirlwind**.

*Brute Justice* will cast **Judgement Nisi**, giving Nisi debuffs to the DPSs or the tanks/healers. From that moment, do not touch anyone except to your partner during the specified “Nisi Pass”. There will be 4 “Nisi Pass” during the phase.  
*Brute Justice* will also cast **Link Up** appying Compressed Lightning on a DPS and Compressed Water on a Healer.

Regroup around the middle of the arena, without touching each other, to bait the *Steam Chakrams* so they go through the middle of the arena. Once they start casting **Eye of the Chakram**, spread and move to the edge of the arena to dodge them.  
While dodging the *Chakrams*, *Cruise Chaser* will cast **Optical Sight**, placing an AoE under everyone. When the *Chakrams* dash, **Optical Sight** will snapshot your position. Since the path is clear, move back mid, still without touching each other, to avoid the **Optical Sight** than will explose a 5 seconds later.

{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="chakram1.jpg;chakram2.jpg;chakram3.jpg;chakram4.jpg;chakram5.jpg" imgDesc="Spread around the middle to the <em>Chakrams</em>;Move to the edge, out their possible path;<strong>Eye of the Chakram</strong> happens;Move back middle;<strong>Optical Sight</strong> resolves" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Photon** setting everyone's HP to 1. Don't hesitate to use a shields so the Nisi dot or the bosses auto-attacks won’t kill anyone.

<ins>First Nisi Pass</ins>: touch your assigned parner to give him the Nisi debuff.

Once the pass is done, *Cruise Chaser* will cast **Spin Crusher**. Have the *Cruise Chaser* Tank quickly face him outside to not cleave anyone.

A note about the Compressed debuffs:  
Since Compressed Water leaves a *Tornado* that needs to be put at a specific position for future mechanics and the fact that the debuff is randomly passed, Tanks usually don’t interact this debuff in order to not drag <s>BJ's fat ass</s> the bosses everywhere. Instead, they'll take care of Compressed Lightning.

In the mean time, the Healer with Compressed Water goes North and shares the damage (min. 3 players with good mitigation) and quickly leave the newborn tornado to not die. Remember to not touch each other. The DPS with Compressed Lightning will move to next to *Brute Justice* Tank to share with him.  
Once the debuff resolve, move away from the *Tornado* and go into positions for the next mechanic.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="comp1-1.jpg;comp1-2.jpg;Comp1-3.jpg" imgDesc="Get in position;The debuffs resolve;Move away from the newborn <em>Tornado</em>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Brute Justice* will now cast **Missile Command**. Since *Brute Justice* is on the West side, **Earth Missile** will be baited on the East side by the *Cruise Chaser* Tank and a designated player (here the Scholar).
They will first bait the **Earth Missile** along the edge, then move to drop the **Hidden Mines**. The mines need to be popped quickly by the *Cruise Chaser* Tank once they're "burried" into the ground.  
The Tank targeted by **Ice Missile** needs to place it near the North *Tornado* to transform it into an ice block useful later. The ice puddle will grow in size over time, so there's no need to put it on top of the *Tornado*, it may bites back if you're coming too close. If the *Cruise Chaser* Tank gets **Ice Missile**, bait the **Hidden Mine**, drop the **Ice Missile** then move to take out the mines.  
For **Enumeration**, it is better to use a priority system such as this one:
	*Brute Justice* < NIN < BRD < SMN < BLM < *Cruise Chaser*: the first DPS on the list who get **Enumeration** will stack near *Brute Justice* with the two free DPS while the second DPS with **Enumeration** will stack near *Cruise Chaser* with the Healers.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="missile1.jpg;missile2.jpg;missile3.jpg;missile4.jpg;missile5.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Earth Missiles</strong> on the baiter;Move out for <strong>Hidden Mine</strong>;<strong>Ice Missile</strong> next to the <em>Tornado</em>, Healers and DPS group for <strong>Enumeration</strong>;Everything resolves;The tank takes out the mines" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

<ins>Second Nisi Pass</ins>: same as before, transfert Nisi to your partner. You can already get into position after you're done with your **Missile Command** mechanic.

Then, the Healer who got the 1st Compressed Water will share Compressed Lightning with *Brute Justice* Tank.  
The Compressed Water player will go South-West-ish and stack with the available players (no Tanks, no Compressed Lightning player, no Water Resistance Down II player).  
*Cruise Chaser* Tank needs to turn *Cruise Chaser* toward the center of the arena for the upcoming mechanic.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="comp2-1.jpg;comp2-2.jpg;Comp2-3.jpg" imgDesc="Get in position;The debuffs resolve;Move away from the newborn <em>Tornado</em>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Brute Justice* will now cast **Verdict** telling you which Nisi debuff you need for **Gavel**. From now on, Nisi will be passed based on Final Judgement: Decree Nisi.

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Limit Cut**, become invulnerable and spawn a *Plasma Shield* in front of him. The shield can only be damaged from the front, has 120k HP and needs to be killed in 6 seconds. *Cruise Chaser* Tank and another DPS should have enough damage to bring it down.  
Meanwhile, *Brute Justice* will cast **Flamethrower**. In order for **Flamethrower** to be casted at the Tank, only the *Brute Justice* Tank should stand inside its hitbox and aim the attack toward the South *Tornado* to remove it.

<ins>Third Nisi Pass (aka Shopping)</ins>: all the players with a Nisi debuff will form a line between *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser*. Then the players without a Nisi will pick the one requested by Final Judgement: Decree Nisi. Take your time to not touch each other.

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Whirlwind** acting as a heal check before the next Compressed debuffs.

The Healer with Compressed Lightning shares with the *Cruise Chaser* Tank on North while the Compressed Water stack is happening South with the available players.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="comp3-1.jpg;comp3-2.jpg;Comp3-3.jpg" imgDesc="Get in position;The debuffs resolve;Move away from the newborn <em>Tornado</em>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The *Cruise Chaser* Tank must move *Cruise Chaser* North behind the *Ice Block* before it casts **Propeller Wind** in order to break the line of sight.  

<ins>Forth Nisi Pass</ins>: the players with Nisi will form a line South of the Ice Block. Then the players without Nisi will stack with the right player accordingly to their Final Judgement: Decree Nisi.  
*Brute Justice* will immediately cast **Gavel** so stay stacked with your duo until Gavel is done, that way if you debuff expires just before **Gavel** cast is over, you will immediately get your Nisi back.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="gavel1.jpg;gavel2.jpg" imgDesc="Let the Nisi players form a line;The other stack with the appropriate Nisi" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The Tanks will move and stack North-East-ish. **Photon** will put them to 1HP soon followed by **Double Rocket Punch** that needs to be shared between them. The rest of the group will move behind Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser (North-West ish) except a ranged that will move to the South.
This player will bait **Super Jump** since it targets the furthest player. After the landing, *Brute Justice* will turn toward the furthest player and cast **Apocalyptic Ray** where everyone should already be out of range. The player who bait has to take a step South to avoid being inside the ray.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="jump1.jpg;jump2.jpg;jump3.jpg" imgDesc="The player wait South;<em>Brute Justice</em> jumps;Have a step back, the rest of the group near the edge" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then **Whirlwind** will be casted twice followed by the enrageq **Eternal Darkness** + **Final Sentence**.

<h2><a id="Alexander PrimeAbilities Breakdown">Abilities Breakdown</a></h2>

+ **<ins>Temporal Stasis</ins>:**
*Alexander* Prime will inflict the following debuffs when the cast time starts:
	+ House Arrest: one Tank/Healer and one DPS will be tethered. These players must be close to each other when the effect resolves.
	+ Restraining Order: one Tank/Healer and one DPS will be tethered. These players must be far from each other when the effect resolves.
	+ Aggravated Assault: on one Tank/Healer and one DPS. Deals damage when the effect resolves and gives a Physical and a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff making any extra damage lethal.
	+ One Tank/Healer and one DPS won’t have any debuffs.  
Once **Temporal Stasis** cast is completed, time will stop (and your buff timer too). The debuffs will be resolved while *Brute Justice* will cast **Flamethrower** toward the two closest targets and *Cruise Chaser* will cast **Alpha Sword** toward the three closest targets.

+ **<ins>Inception Formation</ins>:**

	+ **<ins>Aetheroplasm</ins>:**
   Four plasma orbs will be tethered to four random players. They will slowly move toward their player and explode, dealing <span class="magic">magical damage</span>, on contact with any player. Their size will decrease over time as well as their damage (named **Tetrashatter**).  
   After exploding, they will leave a puddle on the ground, inflicting Heavy to anyone inside. If two puddles overlap, it will wipe the group.

	+ **<ins>Judgement Crystal</ins>:**
   Four random players (not linked to a **Aetheroplasm**) are targeted by AoE markers that will drop a *Judgment Crystal*. The area around a *Judgment Crystals* inflicts a Bleed debuff. If a Judgment Crystal explodes, it will deal based-proximity <span class="magic">magical damage</span>.  
   The Judgment Crystal will explode if:
		+ two *Judgement Crystals* AoE overlap.
		+ it is close to *Alexander Prime* during **Inception**.
		+ the *True Heart* is at the intersection of the *Judgment Crystals*.

	+ **<ins>True Heart</ins>:**
   Add spawned by *Shanoa* that will move toward *Alexander Prime*, if it reaches *Alexander Prime*, he will wipe the group.  
   This is the hidden mechanic of the fight. When it intersects with the four Judgement Crystal, it will become golden and stop for a bit. Once *Alexander Prime* has finished to cast **Inception**, the *True Heart* will move to the place where *Alexander Prime* will teleport. At the same time, it will also grant the Enigma Codex buff to every one, necessary to solve the **Fate Calibrations** in the last phase.

	+ **<ins>Inception</ins>:**

<h2><a id="Alexander PrimeStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

<a id="STemporal Stasis"></a>*Alexander Prime* will appear to the North of the arena while *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* will randomly appear to the East and West of the center. When **Temporal Stasis** cast starts, identify which debuff your have and move to the according position:
	+ House Arrest: the Tank/Healer positions himself North of *Cruise Chaser* while the DPS will be on its South. Both of them has to stand close of *Cruise Chaser* to avoid any mistarget.
	+ Restraining Order: the Tank/Healer will move to the open side of *Cruise Chaser* (midway between the edge and *Cruise Chaser*) while the DPS is near the edge on *Brute Justice* side.
	+ Aggravated Assault: both players are near the edge on *Brute Justice* side. They can stack with the Restraining Order DPS to be sure to not get hit by any attack.
	+ No debuff: the Tank/Healer positions himself North of *Brute Justice* while the DPS will be on its South. Both of them has to stand close of *Brute Justice* to avoid any mistarget.

When **Temporal Stasis** cast is over, Aggravated Assault, House Arrest and Restraining Order will resolve. Then *Brute Justice* will use **Flamethrower** on the players without debuff while *Cruise Chaser* will use Alpha Sword on the House Arrest players and the Restraining Order Tank/Healer:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "temporalStasis.jpg" }}">

*Alexander Prime* will appear in the middle and will cast **Chastening Heat** on the main target followed by 3 **Divine Spear**. Due to invulnerability duration, only the 3 Divine Spear can be invuln through. It means that the tank must survive the initial **Chastening Heat** and the next auto-attack before using his invulnerability.  
However for the first **Chastening Spear**, the delay between **Chastening Heat** and **Divine Spear** is shorter than for the second **Chastening Spear** (one auto-attack instead of two). Meaning that PLD and DRK can use Hallowed Ground and Living Dead to survive all 4 hits.


<a id="SInception Formation"></a>*Alexander Prime* will cast **Inception Formation** then randomly teleport to the North or South edge, *Shanoa* will spawn on the opposite side of *Alexander Prime*. *Brute Justice* will always spawn to the West and *Cruise Chaser* to the East. Wherever *Alexander Prime* spawn will be considered as True North for this mechanic. Meaning that *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* position can be flipped.

Four randoms players get the **Judgement Crystal** marker. The marked players will take positions to the opposite side of *Alexander Prime*. Have to player next the edge, and the other two players can use them as landmark to place their AoE.  
Here is the **Judgment Crystals** positions for both cases if *Alexander Prime* spawn on the other side:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "crystalJudgement.jpg" }}">

The others four players will be tethered to **Aetheroplasm** orbs. Two orbs will spawn on the East side and two others of the West side. Tethered players have to drag their orbs across the arena to reduce their size and bring them on *Alexander Prime* side along the edge.  
In the beginning, move to the opposite side where your orb is and start dragging your orb near *Alexander Prime* so it won’t hinder the players with **Judgement Crystal**. Don't forget to avoid other players orbs.
Two orbs have to be placed under *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* while the others have to be placed on the intercardinal next of *Alexander Prime*.

After a few seconds, the **Judgement Crystal** will appear and the *True Heart* (looks like that titan-egi child that 
nobody wants) will spawn next to Shanoa. The four **Judgement Crystal** players have to move under *Alexander Prime*. In the mean time, **Aetheroplasm** orbs have reached the players and will explode. Once it's done, all these players have to move under *Alexander Prime* too. (Tanks can stand between *Alexander Prime* and *Brute Justice*).

The *True Heart* will move toward *Alexander Prime* and will detonate the **Judgement Crystals** on its way, dealing proximity-based damages. While the **Judgement Crystals** explode, the group, and especially the tanks, will rotate toward *Brute Justice*.

*Brute Justice* will now use **Flamethrower** on the three closest targets in a succession. One Tank will take the first Flamethrower aimed toward the South of the arena. The other Tank will aim the second Flamethrower toward the East, while someone from the rest of the group will bait the last one toward the North and can cleave the rest of group without problem.  
Dealing damage to the *True Heart* has no importance except building gauge or grinding ressources.

*Alexander Prime* will start casting **Inception**, giving debuffs to players. When the cast is over, *Alexander Prime* will teleport away and the *True Heart* will move toward the edge of the arena telling us where *Alexander Prime* will reappear and cast **Sacrament**.
The Tanks and the DPS with Shared Sentence will stack on the left edge while facing *Alexander Prime* destination while the rest of the group will stack on the right edge. **Sacrament** and the debuffs will resolve automatically.

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="inception10.jpg;inception11.jpg;" imgDesc="Tanks and Restraining Order DPS to the left, the others to the right;Everything resolves on its own" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Afterward, *Cruise Chaser* will move to the middle while *Brute Justice* is still on the West edge. *Cruise Chaser* will cast **Alpha Sword** on the three closest players and *Brute Justice* will cast **Super Jump** on the furthest player.
The DPS who had Restraining Order will go West and both Healers will go North and South of *Cruise Chaser*, in close range, to bait **Alpha Sword**. The rest of the group will stack on the East side between *Cruise Chaser* and the edge.
Meanwhile, choose one Tank to always go on the East edge and bait **Super Jump**. After the third **Alpha Sword**, the group who isn't baiting anything has to move inside Cruise Chaser hitbox to be sure to avoid the **Super Jump** AoE.

Another **Chastening Spear** combo (**Chastening Heat** + **Divine Spear**). Use the Tank invulnerability after the first auto-attack following **Chastening Heat**.


<a id="SWormhole Formation"></a>*Alexander Prime* will cast **Wormhole Formation** before disappearing. *Alexander Prime* will teleport South while *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* will spawn randomly on North East and North West.  
<ins>Let’s consider that *Brute Justice* spawned NW and *Cruise Chaser* spawned NE for the following diagrams.</ins>

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Limit Cut**, assigning a number to everyone and *Brute Justice* will cast **Link Up**, summoning two *Steam Chakrams* to the cardinals next to him. The whole group will move under *Brute Justice* to bait them and spread along the edge to easily identify your number. Once the *Steam Chakrams* have their target and start casting, everyone will move to their position according to their number.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="wormhole1.jpg;wormhole2.jpg" imgDesc="Spread under <em>Brute Justice</em>;When the <em>Steam Chakrams</em> start casting, move to your position" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

During this part, odd numbers (1,3,5,7) will always be on the West side of the arena while the even numbers (2,4,6,8) will be on the East side. Depending of your numbers, the **Alpha Sword** or **Super Blasty Charge** will **ALWAYS** be baited on the red dot located at these inter-cardinals:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "wormholeNumbers.jpg" }}">

<ins>**Always use your knockback imunity when getting hit by Limit Cut, USE YOUR KNOCKBACK IMMUNITY WHEN GETTING HIT BY LIMIT CUT.  
Furthemore, odd number must face the edge of the arena to direct Alpha Sword toward the outside**</ins>

While the *Steam Chakrams* are casting, *Alexander Prime* will spawn two **Void of Repentance** on the East and West side, opposite to each other.  
Due to the fact that getting hit by **Limit Cut** and soaking a **Void of Repentance** gives Vulnerability Down debuffs, the puddles need to be soaked by these numbers:
+ 1st puddle → 5 & 6
+ 2nd puddle → 7 & 8
+ 3rd puddle → 1 & 2

With all this information, numbers 1 to 4 will move to their respective intercardinal, while numbers 5 to 8 will move to the red dot on their respective side. If you have nothing to do and waiting for your mechanic, the red dot on East and West are considered safe spots.  
The numbers 7 & 8 will stand on the red dot while the numbers 5 & 6 will stand inside and at the edge of the **Void of Repentance**.  
<ins>Careful</ins>: if a *Steam Chakram* is next to your safe spot, take a few step toward the South and once the *Chakram* is done, go to your position.

The *Steam Chakrams* will go off and the first pair (1 & 2) will receive **Limit Cut**. The player 1 or 2 that is under *Brute Justice* must stay on his red dot until **Apocalyptic Ray** is casted.  
At the same time, *Brute Justice* will use **Super Jump** on the furthest player, opposite of where Brute Justice spawned. The player who's baiting *Brute Justice* mustn't stay on a red dot but in front of it (you can step into a **Void of Repentance** if you have to). Once *Brute Justice* has jumped, move into the red dot to avoid the incoming **Apocalyptic Ray**.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="wormhole3.jpg;wormhole4.jpg;wormhole5.jpg;wormhole6.jpg" imgDesc="Continue to move, here 1, 5 & 7 players have to take care to not be on <em>Steam Chakrams</em> path;<em>Cruise Chaser</em> appears and the <em>Chakrams</em> fire;1 is getting cleaved, he has to move into his red dot while <strong>Alpha Sword</strong> happens;<strong>Super Blasty Charge</strong> on 2 and <em>Brute Justice</em> jumps" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The next **Limit Cut** pair happens (3 & 4) and *Brute Justice* will cast **Apocalyptic Ray** towards the furthest player. The **Void of Repentance** will also explode for the first time.  
Once they soak, 5 & 6 move North while 7 & 8 now stand inside the puddles.  
Once 3 & 4 are done with **Limit Cut**, they can move to their safe spots.

*Alexander Prime* will cast **Sacrament**, 3 & 4 have to move toward their safe spots. They can also bait **Alpha Sword** and **Super Blasty Charge** slightly North of their red dot to have an easier time avoiding **Sacrament**.  
The third **Limit Cut** pair will happen (5 & 6) and the **Void of Repentance** will explode for the second time. Once they soak, 7 & 8 move South while 1 & 2 now stand inside the puddles.

The final part of **Limit Cut** will happen (7 & 8) as well as the last **Void of Repentance** explosion. The number 8 can stand under *Alexander Prime* to be closest to the middle for the last **Super Blasty Charge**.

Everyone quickly regroup and stack mid for **Incinerating Heat**. *Brute Justice* will also cast **Missile Command** targeting two DPS with **Enumeration**. Use the same priority system as the one used during *Bruce Chustice* phase (3 DPS left, 1 DPS + 2 Healers right, tanks out).

Alexander Prime reappears middle and will cast 2 **Mega Holy** that need to be mitigated.

Then he will disappear and reappear with *Brute Justice* (arriving with **J Storm**) and *Cruise Chaser*. *Brute Justice* will cast its soft enrage, **J Wave** that needs to be mitigated through this part while *Alexander Prime* and *Cruise Chaser* will cast their respective hard enrages.  
*Cruise Chaser* needs to be killed first since its enrage, **Eternal Darkness**, is the fastest. Next one is *Brute Justice* and finally *Alexander Prime*.  
(Healers may need to switch to full heal after the 5-6th J Wave.)

LB3 and shields are needed to survive **Divine Judgement** when *Alexander Prime* is killed. Right before **Divine Judgment** is complete, you can use HoTs on the group that will tick during the cutscene to regenerate everyone.

+ **<ins>Final Word</ins>:**
Perfect Alexander will apply the following debuffs where every player will only have one debuff:
	+ Contact Regulation: on one player. Called “light beacon” in this guide.
	+ Contact Prohibition: on three players. Called “light follower” in this guide. When it resolves, the players will automatically move toward the player with **Contact Regulation**, their "beacon". If they touch the "beacon player", they die.

	+ Escape Detection: on one player. Called “dark beacon” in this guide.
	+ Escape Prohibition: on three players. Called “dark follower” in this guide. When it resolves, the players will automatically move away from the player with **Escape Detection**, their "beacon". If they touch or run too far away from the "beacon player", they die.

*Tip: “followers” always have an arrow on their debuff since they’ll move while the “beacon” doesn’t have one since they’ll stay static.*

___

+ **<ins>Ordained Motion</ins>:**
Every player must be moving at the end of the cast or they will die. Denoted by a light sword.

___

+ **<ins>Ordained Stillness</ins>:**
Every player must be standing still and not attacking the boss at the end of the cast or they will die. **Pets must be on "Steady".** Denoted by a dark sword.

	+ **<ins>Individual Reprobation</ins>:** AoE markers on every player. Denoted by the multiples orbs next to *Perfect Alexander*.

___

+ **<ins>Fate Projection</ins>:**
**Fate Projections** always precede **Fate Calibrations**.  
During the cast, *Perfect Alexander* will prepare every mechanic you will receive during the **Fate Calibrations**. However these mechanics will be unknown for each player and they will resolve immediately during **Fate Calibration**.
In order to know which mechanics will happen, Enigma Codex will come into play. During **Fate Projection**, Enigma Codex will create a clone for every player. Each player will have an arrow (compass like) pointing towards their clone. Every mechanic that the player’s clone suffers during **Fate Projection** will happen to that player during the incoming **Fate Calibration**.

___

+ **<ins>Fate Calibration ⍺</ins>:**
	+ First mechanic: **Ordained Motion** or **Ordained Stillness** for everyone depending on the sword colour.

	+ Second mechanic:
		+ Defamation: on one player. Denoted by the huge explosion.
		+ Shared Sentence: on one player. Denoted by the large cog.
		+ Aggravated Assault: on three players. Denoted by the small cog.
		+ Nothing on three players.

	+ Third mechanic: **Ordained Motion** or **Ordained Stillness** for everyone depending on the sword colour.

	+ Fourth mechanic: Four *Perfect Alexander* will appear on the North side. Three of them will cast **Sacrement**, leaving two safe spots, right next to him and to the opposite edge.

___

___

+ **<ins>Fate Calibration ꞵ</ins>:**
	+ First mechanic, **Final Words**:
		+ Light debuffs on four players:
			+ Contact Regulation: on one player. Denoted by this player’s clone not moving and staying close to the edge of the arena.
			+ Contact Prohibition: on three players. Each player will receive one of these: **House Arrest**, **Restraining Order** and **Shared Sentence**.
		+ Dark debuffs on four players:
			+ Escape Detection: on one player. Denoted by this player’s clone not moving and staying close to the edge of the arena.
			+ Escape Prohibition: on three players. Two players will receive one of these: **House Arrest**, **Restraining Order**.

	+ Second Mechanic: Four *Perfect Alexander* will appear on the North side. Three of them will cast **Super Jump**, three players need to bait the jump on the East, West and South cardinals.

A stack marker on a random player dealing huge <span class="magic">magical damage</span>.

___

+ **<ins>Temporal Interference</ins>:**
*Perfect Alexander* soft enrage. *Perfect Alexander* will summon 7 Temporal Prisons located on the 7 circles around the center of the arena. For each prison, a player must be locked inside until the boss is defeated. The group will wipe soon after the seventh prison.
The prisons will spawn in a clockwise manner, starting on the North East.

<h2><a id="Perfect AlexanderStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

Since you may enter this phase with your resources being full (mana + gauge), I recommend to check The Balance/Akhmorning for any specific opener.

*Perfect Alexander* will appear in the middle of the arena with the aggro meter being reset.
He will cast **Final Word**, allocating a debuff to everyone. Immediately move to your assigned position:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "finalWord.jpg" }}">
Here, dark and light followers have been separated for a better understanding but they should stack together.

While moving to your position and before the debuffs resolve, he will cast either **Ordained Motion** or **Ordained Stillness**. When the cast reaches 50%, keep/stop moving as requested. (And put your pet in Guard mode :^) )

The **Final Word** debuffs will resolve and both groups of followers will move toward the light beacon.  
During the forced march, *Perfect Alexander* will cast another **Ordained Motion** or **Ordained Stillness**, the opposite of the first one.  
When the forced march from is over, **Ordained Motion/Stillness** cast time will be at 50%, so immediately keep/stop moving as requested.

Next, *Perfect Alexander* will cast **Optical Sight** twice, either spread then stack or the opposite.
If it's stack, the players who had a dark debuff will stack on the South side of *Perfect Alexander* while the players who had a light debuff will stack on its North side.

<a id="SFate Calibration ⍺"></a>Perfect Alexander will start casting **Fate Calibration**. Players should follow their clone and need to pay attention if they receive Defamation or Aggravated Assault. Shared Sentence is automatically resolved. Remember the color of the two swords for **Ordained Motion/Stillness** and the clone how didn't cast **Sacrement**.

When it comes to position to solve the mechanic, the player with Defamation will head to the North safe spot under the *Perfect Alexander* clone that didn’t fire.  
Meanwhile the rest of the group will move to the South safe spot. Players with Aggravated Assault will stack on the right while the rest will stack on the left:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="fateAlphaAC.jpg;fateAlphaBD.jpg" imgDesc="If the North West clone didn't fire;If the North East clone didn't fire" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When *Perfect Alexander* disappears, players should already be at their designated position and ready to do the first **Ordained Motion/Stillness**.  
The three **Sacraments**, the debuffs and the second **Ordained Motion/Stillness** will resolve at the same time (The same Ordained Motion/Stillness can happen twice in a row here.)


*Perfect Alexander* will then cast **Ordained Capital Punishment** that needs to be share between both tanks, followed by **Ordained Punishment** requiring a swap during the cast.
Paladin and Dark Knight can use they invulnerability on all four hits, while Warrior and Gunbreaker can only invulnerability on the last three hits.

<a id="SFate Calibration ꞵ"></a>Perfect Alexander will cast **Fate Calibration** again. Players should follow their clone and need to pay attention if they’re a dark/light beacon/follower. If you’re a dark follower, check if you received Restraining Order or not. The other debuffs are automatically resolved.  
Remember if the **Optical Sight** is a stack or spread and which clone cast **Radiant Sacrament**.

Once you know your debuff, take the following position:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "fateBeta1.jpg" }}">
+ The light beacon will go North, a few steps toward the West to give enough space for the light followers.
+ The dark beacon will stay along the East edge behind everyone.
+ The dark follower with Restraining Order will aim to be forced to march toward the South.
+ The dark follower without other debuff with aim to be forced to march toward the West.
+ The other players will aim to be forced to march toward the light beacon.

When the forced march is over, players to the East, South and West have to walk into the cardinal to bait the **Super Jumps**. And the group North will stack together:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "fateBeta2.jpg" }}">
All the debuffs will resolve at the same time as the Super Jumps.

Following is **Optical Sight**:
+ Stack: the players who had a dark debuff will stack on the South side of Perfect Alexander while the players who had a light debuff will stack on its North side.
+ Spread: dark players will stay at their cardinal position while the light player will spread around the center of the arena.

Once **Optical Sight** is done, run/sprint to the clone that will use **Radiant Sacrament**.

Once again, *Perfect Alexander* will cast **Ordained Capital Punishment** and **Ordained Punishment**.

*Perfect Alexander* will cast **Almighty Judgment**. The three set of AoE will use the patterns bellow:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "almightyJudgment.jpg" }}">
The solution here is to find and move into the third set of AoE. Then, move into the first set when it explodes.  
For example, if the set is: Yellow > Blue > Red. Everyone will stand at C, then move to D once the Yellow AoEs happen.

When the last set of **Almighty Judgment** explodes, **Irresistible Grace** cast will be completed, needing at least 20% mitigation + shields. Since this **Irresistible Grace** and the next one are the last raid-wide damage abilities, it can be over mitigated.

Last tank-busters with **Ordained Capital Punishment** and **Ordained Punishment**.

Another **Almighty Judgment** is cast, resolved in the same way as the previous. This **Irresistible Grace** doesn’t need to be healed since there is no more raid-wide damage afterwards, allowing the healer to focus on dps.  
Your second potion of the phase and the LB3 can be popped anytime after **Irresistible Grace**.

*Perfect Alexander* will begin his soft enrage with **Temporal Interference**. The order for the prisons should be based on player DPS, with the lowest DPS being imprisonned first.
