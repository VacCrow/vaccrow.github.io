___

+ **<ins>Fluid Swing / Swipe</ins>:**

___

+ **<ins>Hand of Parting / Prayer</ins>:**
*Liquid Hand* will glow and change its shape:
  + Into a closed fist/fist-bump, if he's close to *Living Liquid*. After a few seconds, it will insta-cast **Hand of Prayer**. *Liquid Hand* needs to be pulled far enough from *Living Liquid* before the cast happen. It will deal small raid-wide <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> if the condition is respected, otherwise the group will wipe.

  + Into a open hand/high-five, if he's far to *Living Liquid*. After a few seconds, it will insta-cast **Hand of Parting**. *Liquid Hand* needs to be pulled close enough to *Living Liquid* before the cast happen. It will deal small raid-wide <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> if the condition is respected, otherwise the group will wipe.

___

+ **<ins>Protean Waves</ins>:**
A thin cone AoE targeting the closest player dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'>Water Resistance Down II</span> debuff lasting 4 seconds. **Protean Waves** can be cast from *Living Liquid* or *Tornadoes*, simultaneously or not:
  + Each *Tornado* will cast two **Protean Waves** in a row, the first one has a telegraph and can be dodged and the second is instant.

  + *Living Liquid* will cast three sets of **Protean Waves** in a row:
    + First set: **Living Liquid** will target every player with a telegraphed **Protean Wave**. The one aimed at the main Target will repeat during the two next sets and without a telegraph.
    + Second and third sets: **Living Liquid** will only target the 4 closest players with an instant **Protean Wave**. But due to the <span class='debuff'>Water Resistance Down II</span> debuff duration, it is impossible to get hit by two **Protean Waves** in a row.

___

+ **<ins>Embolus</ins>:**
Orbs spawning from two random *Tornadoes* after they cast **Protean Wave**. When they spawn, one orb will aim at the position where *Living Liquid* is and the other at *Liquid Hand* position.

___

+ **<ins>Jagd Dolls</ins>:**
Four **Jagd Dolls** will spawn around the arena, they will tether to the first player who hit them. If a doll die, it will wipe the party.

+ **<ins>Drainage</ins>:**
Two tethers emanating from two *Tornadoes*. After 5 seconds, they explode as an AoE tank buster around their bearer, dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span>.  
*Tip: when the tethers appear, the Tornadoes scan for targets from the South to the North of the arena (cardinals based on the tornadoes and North being the cardianl without tornado) and will give the tethers to the two first players found. That way, if both tanks are the Southest players, they will automatically get the tethers.*

<h2>Strategy</h2>

The Easiest Limit Cut:
After the first explosion, one group (with numbers 1, 2, 5 and 6) go to the North or East, and the other group (3, 4, 7 and 8) go South or West.
Everyone follows the AoEs. For each group, the next duo to be attacked runs in the inner ring and the other duo runs in the outer ring. Odd numbered players face the next AoE in front of him to not cleave anyone and the even numbered player faces his duo mate.
Once a duo is hit, swap your ring position with the other duo.
Rinse and repeat
(You can stop moving after the 3rd AoE of the second set)

<h2><a id='Phase2-BruteJustice&CruiseChaserStrategy'>Strategy</a></h2>

After **Limit Cut**, regroup mid and heal for the incoming **J-Kick** followed by **Whirlwind**.

*Brute Justice* will cast **Judgement Nisi**, giving <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> debuffs to the DPSs or the Tanks/Healers. From that moment, do not touch anyone except your partner during the specified “Nisi Pass”. There will be 4 “Nisi Pass” during the phase.  
*Brute Justice* will also cast **Link Up** appying <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Lightning</span> on a DPS and <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Water</span> on a Healer.

Regroup around the middle of the arena, without touching each other, to bait the **Eye of the Chakram** so they go through the middle of the arena. Once the casts start, spread and move to the edge of the arena to dodge them, out of the *Chakrams* path.  
While dodging the *Chakrams*, *Cruise Chaser* will cast **Optical Sight**, placing an AoE under everyone. When the *Chakrams* dash, **Optical Sight** will snapshot your position. Since the path is clear, move back mid, still without touching each other, to avoid the **Optical Sight** than will explose a 5 seconds later.

{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="chakram1.jpg;chakram2.jpg;chakram3.jpg;chakram4.jpg;chakram5.jpg" imgDesc="Spread around the middle to bait the <em>Chakrams</em>;Move to the edge, out their path;<strong>Eye of the Chakram</strong> happens;Move back middle;<strong>Optical Sight</strong> resolves" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Photon** setting everyone's HP to 1. Don't hesitate to use a shields so the Nisi DoT or the bosses auto-attacks won’t kill anyone.

<u>First Nisi Pass</u>: meet your assigned parner to give him the <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> debuff.

Once the pass is done, *Cruise Chaser* will cast **Spin Crusher**. Have the *Cruise Chaser* Tank quickly face him outside to not cleave anyone.

> *A note about the <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed</span> debuffs:*  
> *Since <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Water</span> leaves a Tornado that needs to be put at a specific position for future mechanics and the fact that this debuff is randomly passed,  Tanks usually don’t interact this debuff ~~in order to not drag BJ's fat ass~~ for consistency. Instead, they'll take care of <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Lightning</span>.*

In the mean time, the Healer with <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Water</span> goes North and shares the damage (minimum 3 players with good mitigation) and quickly leave the newborn tornado to not die. Remember to not touch each other. The DPS with Compressed Lightning will move to next to *Brute Justice* Tank to share with him.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="comp1-1.jpg;comp1-2.jpg;Comp1-3.jpg" imgDesc="Get in position;<span class='speDebuff'>Compressed</span> debuffs resolve;Move away from the <em>Tornado</em>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Next *Brute Justice* will now cast **Missile Command**. Since *Brute Justice* is on the West side, **Earth Missile** will be baited on the East side by the *Cruise Chaser* Tank and a designated player (here the Scholar).  
They will first bait the **Earth Missile** along the edge, then move in to drop the **Hidden Mines**. The mines need to be popped quickly by the *Cruise Chaser* Tank once they're "burried" into the ground.  
The Tank targeted by **Ice Missile** needs to place it near the North *Tornado* to transform it into an *Ice Block* for later. The ice puddle will grow in size over time, so there's no need to put it on top of the *Tornado* since it may bite back if you're coming too close. If the *Cruise Chaser* Tank gets **Ice Missile**, bait the **Hidden Mine**, drop the **Ice Missile** then move to take out the mines.  
Right after **Earth Missile** is **Enumeration**, it is better to use a priority system such as this one:  

+ <u><em>Brute Justice</em> <- NIN <- BRD <- SMN <- BLM <- <em>Cruise Chaser</em></u>  
  The first DPS on the list who get **Enumeration** will stack near *Brute Justice* with the two free DPS while the second DPS with **Enumeration** will stack near *Cruise Chaser* with the Healers.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="missile1.jpg;missile2.jpg;missile3.jpg;missile4.jpg;missile5.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Earth Missiles</strong> on the baiters;Move out for <strong>Hidden Mine</strong>;<strong>Ice Missile</strong> placed next to the <em>Tornado</em>, Healers and DPS group up for <strong>Enumeration</strong>;Everything resolves;The tank takes out the mines" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

<u>Second Nisi Pass</u>: same as before, transfert <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> to your partner. You can already get into position after you're done with your **Missile Command** mechanic.

Then, the Healer who got the 1st <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Water</span> will share <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Lightning</span> with *Brute Justice* Tank.  
The <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Water</span> player will go South-West-ish and stack with the available players (no Tanks, no <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Lightning</span>, no <span class='debuff'>Water Resistance Down II</span> player).  
In the meantime, *Cruise Chaser* Tank needs to turn his boss toward the center of the arena for the upcoming mechanic.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

*Brute Justice* will now cast **Verdict** telling you which <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> debuff you need for **Gavel**. From now on, <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> tranfers will be based on <span class='speDebuff'>Final Judgment: Decree Nisi α, β, γ or δ</span>.

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Limit Cut**, become invulnerable and spawn a *Plasma Shield* in front of him. The shield can only be damaged from the front and needs to be killed in 6 seconds. *Cruise Chaser* Tank and one DPS should have enough damage to bring it down.  
Meanwhile, *Brute Justice* will cast **Flamethrower**. In order for **Flamethrower** to be casted at the Tank, only the *Brute Justice* Tank should stand inside its hitbox and aim the attack toward the South *Tornado* to remove it.

<u>Third Nisi Pass (aka Shopping)</u>: all the players with a <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> debuff will form a line between *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser*. Then the players without a debuff will pick the one requested by <span class='speDebuff'>Final Judgment: Decree Nisi</span>. Take your time to not touch each other.

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Whirlwind** acting as a heal check before the next <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed</span> debuffs.

The Healer with <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Lightning</span> shares with the *Cruise Chaser* Tank on North while the <span class='speDebuff'>Compressed Water</span> stack is happening South with the available players.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

The *Cruise Chaser* Tank must move *Cruise Chaser* North behind the *Ice Block* before it casts **Propeller Wind** in order to break the line of sight.  

<u>Forth Nisi Pass</u>: the players with <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> will form a line, South of the *Ice Block*. Then the players without debuff will stack with the right player accordingly to their <span class='speDebuff'>Final Judgment: Decree Nisi</span>.  
*Brute Justice* will immediately cast **Gavel** so stay stacked with your duo until **Gavel** is done, that way if your debuff expires just before **Gavel** cast is over, you will immediately get it back.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="gavel1.jpg;gavel2.jpg" imgDesc="Let the <span class='speDebuff'>Final Decree Nisi</span> players form a line;The other stack to get the appropriate one" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The Tanks will move and stack North-East-ish. **Photon** will put them to 1HP soon followed by **Double Rocket Punch** that needs to be shared between them. The rest of the group will move behind Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser (North-West ish) except a ranged that will move to the South.
This player will bait **Super Jump**. After the landing, *Brute Justice* will turn toward the furthest player, towards North, and cast **Apocalyptic Ray** where everyone should already be out of range. The player who bait has to take a step South to avoid being inside the ray.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="jump1.jpg;jump2.jpg;jump3.jpg" imgDesc="The player wait South;<em>Brute Justice</em> jumps;Have a step back, the rest of the group near the edge" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then **Whirlwind** will be casted twice followed by the enrages **Eternal Darkness** & **Final Sentence**.

  This is the hidden mechanic of the fight. When it touches *Judgment Crystal*, it will blow it up and gain a stack of <span class='buff'>Vulnerability Down</span> buff. At four stacks, *True Heart* will transform and gain the <span class='buff'>Enigma Codex</span> buff.  
  Once *Alexander Prime* has finished to cast **Inception**, the transformed *True Heart* will move to the place where *Alexander Prime* will teleport. At the same time, it will also grant the <span class='buff'>Enigma Codex</span> buff to every one, necessary to solve the **Fate Calibrations** in the last phase.

    ___

  + **<ins>Inception</ins>:**
  *Alexander Prime* will teleport at random location on the edge and cast **Sacrament** while inflicting the following debuffs at the beginning of the cast:

<h2><a id='Phase3-AlexanderPrimeStrategy'>Strategy</a></h2>

<a id='STemporalStasis'></a>*Alexander Prime* will appear to the North of the arena while *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* will randomly appear to the East and West of the center. When **Temporal Stasis** cast starts, identify which debuff your have and move to the according position:

+ <span class='speDebuff'>House Arrest</span>: the Tank/Healer positions himself North of *Cruise Chaser* while the DPS will be on its South. Both of them has to stand close of *Cruise Chaser* to avoid any mistarget.
+ <span class='speDebuff'>Restraining Order</span>: the Tank/Healer will move to the open side of *Cruise Chaser* (midway between the edge and *Cruise Chaser*) while the DPS is near the edge on *Brute Justice* side.
+ <span class='speDebuff'>Aggravated Assault</span>: both players are near the edge on *Brute Justice* side. They can stack with the <span class='speDebuff'>Restraining Order</span> DPS to be sure to not get hit by any attack.
+ No debuff: the Tank/Healer positions himself North of *Brute Justice* while the DPS will be on his South. Both of them has to stand close of *Brute Justice* to avoid any mistarget.

When **Temporal Stasis** cast is over, <span class='speDebuff'>Aggravated Assault</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>House Arrest</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Restraining Order</span> will resolve. Then *Brute Justice* will use **Flamethrower** on the players without debuff while *Cruise Chaser* will use **Alpha Sword** on the <span class='speDebuff'>House Arrest</span> players and the <span class='speDebuff'>Restraining Order</span> Tank/Healer:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'temporalStasis.jpg' }}'>

*Alexander Prime* will appear in the middle and will cast **Chastening Heat** on the main target followed by 3 **Divine Spear**. Use a Tank invulnerability for these.

<a id='SInceptionFormation'></a>*Alexander Prime* will cast **Inception Formation** then randomly teleport to the North or South edge, *Shanoa* will spawn on the opposite side of *Alexander Prime*. *Brute Justice* will always spawn to the West and *Cruise Chaser* to the East. Wherever *Alexander Prime* spawn will be considered as True North for this mechanic. Meaning that *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* position can be flipped.

Four randoms players get the **Judgement Crystal** marker. The marked players will take positions to the opposite side of *Alexander Prime* and form a square shape. The two players next to the edge can used as a landmark for the other 2 to place their AoE.  
Here is the **Judgment Crystals** positions for both cases:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'crystalJudgement.jpg' }}'>

The others four players will be tethered to **Aetheroplasm** orbs. Two orbs will spawn on the East side and two others of the West side. Tethered players have to drag their orbs across the arena to reduce their size and bring them on *Alexander Prime* side along the edge.  
In the beginning, move to the opposite side where your orb is and start dragging your orb near *Alexander Prime* so it won’t hinder the players with **Judgement Crystal**. Don't forget to avoid other players orbs.
Two orbs have to be placed under *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* while the others have to be placed on the intercardinal next of *Alexander Prime*.

After a few seconds, the **Judgement Crystal** will appear and the *True Heart* (looks like that titan-egi child that nobody wants) will spawn next to Shanoa. The four **Judgement Crystal** players have to move under *Alexander Prime*.  
In the mean time, **Aetheroplasm** orbs have reached the players and will explode. Once it's done, all these players have to move under *Alexander Prime* too. (Due to their innate resistance Tanks don't have to be right under *Alexander Prime*).

The *True Heart* will move toward *Alexander Prime* and will detonate the **Judgement Crystals** on its way, dealing proximity-based damages. While the **Judgement Crystals** explode, the group, and especially the tanks, will rotate toward *Brute Justice*.

*Brute Justice* will now use **Flamethrower** on the three closest targets in a succession. One Tank will take the first Flamethrower aimed toward the South of the arena. The other Tank will aim the second Flamethrower toward the middle of the arena, while someone from the rest of the group will bait the last one toward the North and can cleave the rest of group without problem.  
Dealing damage to the *True Heart* has no importance except building gauge or grinding ressources.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="inception7.jpg;inception8.jpg;inception9.jpg" imgDesc="First <strong>Flamethrower</strong>;Second <strong>Flamethrower</strong>;Third <strong>Flamethrower</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Alexander Prime* will start casting **Inception**, giving debuffs to players. When the cast is over, *Alexander Prime* will teleport away and the *True Heart* will move toward the edge of the arena telling us where *Alexander Prime* will reappear and cast **Sacrament**.
The Tanks and the DPS with <span class='speDebuff'>Shared Sentence</span> will stack near the left edge while facing *Alexander Prime* destination while the rest of the group will stack near the right edge. **Sacrament** and the debuffs will resolve automatically.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="inception10.jpg;inception11.jpg;" imgDesc="Tanks and Restraining Order DPS to the left, the others to the right;Everything resolves on its own" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Afterward, *Cruise Chaser* will move to the middle while *Brute Justice* is still on the West edge. *Cruise Chaser* will cast **Alpha Sword** on the three closest players and *Brute Justice* will cast **Super Jump** on the furthest player.
The DPS who had Restraining Order will go West and both Healers will go North and South of *Cruise Chaser*, in close range, to bait **Alpha Sword**. The rest of the group will stack on the East side between *Cruise Chaser* and the edge.
Meanwhile, choose one Tank to always go on the East edge and bait **Super Jump**. After the third **Alpha Sword**, the group who isn't baiting anything has to move inside Cruise Chaser hitbox to be sure to avoid the **Super Jump** AoE.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="inception12.jpg;inception13.jpg" imgDesc="The three baiters have to the closest to <em>Cruise Chaser</em>;After the third <strong>Alpha Sword</strong>, move away from the Eastern Tank" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Another **Chastening Spear** combo (**Chastening Heat** + **Divine Spear**). Use the Tank invulnerability for these.
> Due to invulnerabilities duration and the fact that there's 9 seconds between **Chastening Heat** and the last **Divine Spear**, it may be preferable to mitigate and survive the initial **Chastening Heat** before using the Tank invulnerability.

<a id='SWormholeFormation'></a>Now *Alexander Prime* will cast **Wormhole Formation** before disappearing. *Alexander Prime* will teleport South while *Brute Justice* and *Cruise Chaser* will spawn randomly on North East and North West.  
<u>Let’s consider that *Brute Justice* spawned NW and *Cruise Chaser* spawned NE for the following diagrams.</u>

*Cruise Chaser* will cast **Limit Cut**, assigning a number to everyone and *Brute Justice* will cast **Link Up**, summoning two *Steam Chakrams* to the cardinals next to him. The whole group will move under *Brute Justice* to bait **Eye of the Chakram** and spread along the edge to easily identify your number. Once the *Steam Chakrams* have their target and start casting, everyone will move to their position according to their number.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="wormhole1.jpg;wormhole2.jpg" imgDesc="Spread under <em>Brute Justice</em>;When the <em>Steam Chakrams</em> start casting, move to your position" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

During this part, odd numbers (1,3,5,7) will always be on the West side of the arena while the even numbers (2,4,6,8) will be on the East side. Depending of your numbers, the **Alpha Sword** or **Super Blasty Charge** will **ALWAYS** be baited on the red dot located at these inter-cardinals:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'wormholeNumbers.jpg' }}'>

> Always use your knockback imunity when getting hit by Limit Cut.  
> Furthemore, odd number must face the edge of the arena to direct Alpha Sword toward the outside

While the *Steam Chakrams* are casting, *Alexander Prime* will spawn two **Void of Repentance** on the East and West side, opposite to each other.  
Due to the fact that getting hit by **Limit Cut** and soaking a **Void of Repentance** gives Vulnerability Down debuffs, the puddles need to be soaked by these numbers:

+ 1st puddle → 5 & 6
+ 2nd puddle → 7 & 8
+ 3rd puddle → 1 & 2

With all this information, numbers 1 to 4 will move to their respective intercardinal, while numbers 5 to 8 will move to the red dot on their respective East and West side. If you have nothing to do and waiting for your mechanic, the red dot on East and West are considered safe spots.  
The numbers 7 & 8 will stand on the red dot while the numbers 5 & 6 will stand inside and at the edge of the **Void of Repentance**.  
> Careful: if a *Steam Chakram* is next to your safe spot, take a few step toward the South and once the *Chakram* is done, go back to your position.

The *Steam Chakrams* will go off and the first pair (1 & 2) will receive **Limit Cut**. The player 1 or 2 that is under *Brute Justice* must stay on his red dot until **Apocalyptic Ray** is casted.  
At the same time, *Brute Justice* will use **Super Jump** on the furthest player, opposite of where Brute Justice spawned. The player who's baiting *Brute Justice* mustn't stay on a red dot but in front of it (you can step into a **Void of Repentance** if you have to). Once *Brute Justice* has jumped, move into the red dot to avoid the incoming **Apocalyptic Ray**.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="wormhole3.jpg;wormhole4.jpg;wormhole5.jpg;wormhole6.jpg" imgDesc="Continue to move, here 1, 5 & 7 players have to take care to not be on <em>Steam Chakrams</em> path;<em>Cruise Chaser</em> appears and the <em>Chakrams</em> fire;1 is getting cleaved, he has to move into his red dot while <strong>Alpha Sword</strong> happens;<strong>Super Blasty Charge</strong> on 2 and <em>Brute Justice</em> jumps" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The next **Limit Cut** pair happens (3 & 4) and *Brute Justice* will cast **Apocalyptic Ray** towards the furthest player. The **Void of Repentance** will also explode for the first time.  
Once they soak, 5 & 6 move North while 7 & 8 now stand inside the puddles.  
Once 3 & 4 are done with **Limit Cut**, they can move to their safe spots.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

*Alexander Prime* will cast **Sacrament**, 3 & 4 have to move toward their safe spots. They can also bait **Alpha Sword** and **Super Blasty Charge** slightly North of their red dot to have an easier time avoiding **Sacrament**.  
The third **Limit Cut** pair will happen (5 & 6) and the **Void of Repentance** will explode for the second time. Once they have soaked, 7 & 8 move South while 1 & 2 now stand inside the puddles.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

The final part of **Limit Cut** will happen (7 & 8) as well as the last **Void of Repentance** explosion. The number 8 can stand under *Alexander Prime* to be closest to the middle for the last **Super Blasty Charge**.

Quickly regroup and stack mid for **Incinerating Heat**. *Brute Justice* will also cast **Missile Command** targeting two DPS with **Enumeration**. Use the same priority system as the one used during *Bruce Chustice* phase (3 DPS left, 1 DPS + 2 Healers right, tanks out).

Alexander Prime reappears middle and will cast 2 **Mega Holy** that need to be mitigated.

Then he will disappear and reappear with *Brute Justice* (arriving with **J Storm**) and *Cruise Chaser*. *Brute Justice* will cast its soft enrage, **J Wave** that needs to be mitigated through this part while *Alexander Prime* and *Cruise Chaser* will cast their respective hard enrages.  
*Cruise Chaser* needs to be killed first since its enrage, **Eternal Darkness**, is the fastest. Next one is *Brute Justice* and finally *Alexander Prime*.  
(Healers may need to switch to full heal after the 5-6th J Wave.)

LB3 and shields are needed to survive **Divine Judgement** when *Alexander Prime* is killed. Right before **Divine Judgment** is complete, you can use HoTs on the group that will tick during the cutscene to regenerate everyone.

<h2><a id='Phase4-PerfectAlexanderAbilitiesBreakdown'>Abilities Breakdown</a></h2>

+ **<ins>Final Word</ins>:**
Perfect Alexander will apply the following debuffs where every player will only have one debuff:

  + <span class='speDebuff'>Final Word: Contact Regulation</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.TEA.FinalWordContactRegulation }}'>: on one player. Called “light beacon” in this guide.

If they touch or run too far away from the "beacon player", they die.

> “Followers” always have an arrow on their debuff since they’ll move while the “beacon” doesn’t have one since they are static.

___

+ **<ins>Ordained Motion</ins>:**
Every player must be moving at the end of the cast or they will die. Denoted by a light sword.

___

+ **<ins>Ordained Stillness</ins>:**
Every player must be standing still and not attacking the boss at the end of the cast or they will die. ~~Pets must be on "Steady"~~ Denoted by a dark sword.

___

___

+ **<ins>Fate Projection</ins>:**
**Fate Projections** always precede **Fate Calibrations**.  
During the cast, *Perfect Alexander* will prepare every mechanic you will receive during the **Fate Calibrations**. However these mechanics will be unknown for each player and they will resolve immediately during **Fate Calibration**.
In order to know which mechanics will happen, <span class='buff'>Enigma Codex</span> will come into play. During **Fate Projection**, <span class='buff'>Enigma Codex</span> will create a clone for every player. Each player will have an arrow (compass like) pointing towards their clone. Every mechanic that the player’s clone suffers during **Fate Projection** will happen to that player during the incoming **Fate Calibration**.

___

+ **<ins>Fate Calibration ⍺</ins>:**
  + First mechanic: **Ordained Motion** or **Ordained Stillness** for everyone depending on the sword colour.

  + Second mechanic:

A three-hit tank buster on the main target dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> that can be shared with the other tank. Always followed by **Ordained Punishment**.

___

+ **<ins>Ordained Punishment</ins>:**
Tank buster on the main target dealing high <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'>Physical Vulnerability Up</span> debuff for 30 seconds. Since *Perfect Alexander* auto-attack deals <span class='phys'>physical damage</span>, a swap is required.

___

+ **<ins>Fate Calibration ꞵ</ins>:**
  + First mechanic, **Final Words**:
    + Light debuffs on four players:
      + <span class='speDebuff'>Final Word: Contact Regulation</span>: on one player. Denoted by this player’s clone not moving and staying close to the edge of the arena.
      + <span class='speDebuff'>Final Word: Contact Prohibition</span>: on three players. Each player will receive one of these: <span class='speDebuff'>House Arrest</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Restraining Order</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Shared Sentence</span>.

  + Fourth mechanic: One of the *Perfect Alexander* that jumped will cast **Radiant Sacrament**.

___

+ **<ins>Almighty Judgment</ins>:**
*Perfect Alexander* will show three sets of AoE, dealing no damage. They will be repeated, in the same order, during the cast of **Irresistible Grace** and will inflict lethal damage if hit. These AoEs need to be avoided as a group.

___

+ **<ins>Irresistible Grace</ins>:**
A stack marker on a random player dealing huge <span class='magic'>magical damage</span>.

___

+ **<ins>Temporal Interference</ins>:**
*Perfect Alexander* soft enrage. *Perfect Alexander* will summon 7 Temporal Prisons located on the 7 circles around the center of the arena. For each prison, a player must be locked inside until the boss is defeated. The group will wipe soon after the seventh prison.
The prisons will spawn in a clockwise manner, starting on the North East.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<h2><a id='Phase4-PerfectAlexanderStrategy'>Strategy</a></h2>

Since you may enter this phase with your resources being full (mana + gauge), your opener may vary.

*Perfect Alexander* will appear in the middle of the arena with the aggro meter being reset.
He will cast **Final Word**, allocating a debuff to everyone. Immediately move to your assigned position:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'finalWord.jpg' }}'>
Here, dark and light followers have been separated for a better understanding but they should stack together.

While moving to your position and before the debuffs resolve, he will cast either **Ordained Motion** or **Ordained Stillness**. When the cast reaches 50%, keep/stop moving as requested (and put your pet in Guard mode KEKW).

The **Final Word** debuffs will resolve and both groups of followers will move toward the light beacon.  
During the forced march, *Perfect Alexander* will cast another **Ordained Motion** or **Ordained Stillness**, the opposite of the first one.  
When the forced march from is over, **Ordained Motion/Stillness** cast time will be at 50%, so immediately keep/stop moving as requested.

Next, *Perfect Alexander* will cast **Optical Sight** twice, either spread then stack or the opposite.
If it's stack, the players who had a dark debuff will stack on the South side of *Perfect Alexander* while the players who had a light debuff will stack on its North side.

<a id='SFateCalibration⍺'></a>*Perfect Alexander* will start casting **Fate Calibration**. Players should follow their clone and need to pay attention if they receive <span class='speDebuff'>Defamation</span> or <span class='speDebuff'>Aggravated Assault</span>. <span class='speDebuff'>Shared Sentence</span> is automatically resolved so no need to pay attention. Remember the color of the two set of swords for **Ordained Motion/Stillness** and the clone how didn't cast **Sacrement**. It is always one of the two clones next to the North cardinal that don't fire.

When it comes to positions to solve the mechanic, the player with <span class='speDebuff'>Defamation</span> will head to the North safe spot under the *Perfect Alexander* clone that didn’t fire.  
Meanwhile the rest of the group will move to the South safe spot. Players with <span class='speDebuff'>Aggravated Assault</span> will stack on the right while the rest will stack on the left:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="fateAlphaAC.jpg;fateAlphaBD.jpg" imgDesc="If the North West clone didn't fire;If the North East clone didn't fire" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When *Perfect Alexander* disappears, players should already be at their designated position and ready to do the first **Ordained Motion/Stillness**.  
The three **Sacraments**, the debuffs and the second **Ordained Motion/Stillness** will resolve at the same time (The same **Ordained Motion/Stillness** can happen twice in a row here.)

*Perfect Alexander* will then cast **Ordained Capital Punishment** that needs to be share between both tanks, followed by **Ordained Punishment** requiring a swap during the cast. Use a Tank invulnerability or share with Tanks then swap during **Ordained Punishment**.

<a id='SFateCalibrationꞵ'></a>Once again, *Perfect Alexander* will cast **Fate Calibration**. Players should follow their clone and need to pay attention if they’re a dark/light beacon/follower. If you’re a dark follower, check if you received <span class='speDebuff'>Restraining Order</span> or not. The other debuffs are automatically resolved.  
Remember if the **Optical Sight** is a stack or spread and which clone cast **Radiant Sacrament**.

Once you know your debuff, take the following position:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'fateBeta1.jpg' }}'>

+ The light beacon will go North, a few steps toward the West to give enough space for the light followers.
+ The dark beacon will stay along the East edge behind everyone.
+ The dark follower with Restraining Order will aim to be forced to march toward the South.
+ The dark follower without other debuff with aim to be forced to march toward the West.
+ The other players will aim to be forced to march toward the light beacon.

When the forced march is over, players to the East, South and West have to walk into the cardinal to bait the **Super Jumps**. And the group North will stack together:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'fateBeta2.jpg' }}'>
All the debuffs will resolve at the same time as the **Super Jumps**.

Next is **Optical Sight** and if it is:

+ Stack: the players who had a dark debuff will stack on the South side of *Perfect Alexander* while the players who had a light debuff will stack on its North side.
+ Spread: dark players will stay at their cardinal position while the light player will spread around the center of the arena.

Once **Optical Sight** is done, run/sprint to the clone that will use **Radiant Sacrament**.

Once again, *Perfect Alexander* will cast **Ordained Capital Punishment** and **Ordained Punishment**. Use a Tank invulnerability or share with Tanks then swap during **Ordained Punishment**.

*Perfect Alexander* will cast **Almighty Judgment**. The three set of AoE will use the patterns bellow:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'almightyJudgment.jpg' }}'>
The solution here is to find and move into the third set of AoE. Then, move into the first set when it explodes.  
For example, if the set is: Yellow > Blue > Red. Everyone will stand at C, then move to D once the Yellow AoEs happen.

When the last set of **Almighty Judgment** explodes, **Irresistible Grace** cast will be completed, needing at least 20% mitigation + shields. Since this **Irresistible Grace** and the next one are the last raid-wide damage abilities, it can be over mitigated.

Last tank-busters with **Ordained Capital Punishment** and **Ordained Punishment**. Use a Tank invulnerability or share with Tanks then swap during **Ordained Punishment**.

Another **Almighty Judgment** is cast, resolved in the same way as the previous. This **Irresistible Grace** doesn’t need to be healed since there is no more raid-wide damage afterwards, allowing the healer to focus on dps.  
Your second potion of the phase and the LB3 can be popped anytime after **Irresistible Grace** for the last reopener.

*Perfect Alexander* will begin his soft enrage with **Temporal Interference**. The order for the prisons should be based on player DPS, with the lowest DPS being imprisonned first.
