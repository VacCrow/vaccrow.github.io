<h2><a id="Living LiquidAbilities Breakdown">Abilities Breakdown</a></h2>

Fluid Swing / Swipe:
Physical cleave tank buster that applies Water Resistance Down II debuff for 4 seconds. Doesn’t have a cast time.

Cascade: 
High raidwide magical damage and spawn tornadoes and Liquid Hand on the first usage.

Hand of Parting / Prayer:
The hand needs to be pulled to or away from the boss, depending on its shape, a failure will result in a wipe. This mechanic can be “baited”: 
If Liquid Hand and Living Liquid are close to each other, the Hand will take the shape of a fist and need to be pulled away from Living Liquid. (named Hand of Parting)
If they’re away from each other, Liquid Hand will have the shape of a high-five and both of them need to be stacked together. (named Hand of Prayer)

Hand Of Pain:
Cast by Liquid Hand 4 times throughout the phase. Will wipe the group if the difference of HP between Liquid Hand and Living Liquid is above 5% otherwise it will inflict some small magical damage.
Hand of Pain goes through Invulnerability LOLDRK.

Tornados Protean:
Each tornado will cast a telegraphed protean wave at the nearest player (that can be dodged) and cast another instant one at the nearest player. Afterward, an Embolus will spawn inside two tornadoes.

Embolus: 
Orbs spawning from two random tornados. One orb will move toward Living Liquid and the other orb will move toward Liquid Hand. Their targets are set when the Embolus spawn. If an orb touches either a player or one of the bosses, it will be a wipe.

Jagd Dolls:
Four dolls will spawn and each of them will tether onto the first person that hit them. Must be brought to low HP, and fed to Living Liquid/Liquid Hand. Deal magical raidwide damage when fed.
The party will wipe if any doll dies.
Each doll will use Exhaust every 10 seconds in a small range around them, applying a stack of Luminous Aetherplasm upon being hit that last 5 seconds. Getting two stacks will wipe the party. 

Protean Waves: 
A thin magical cone AoE targeting the closest player, getting each inflict a Water Resistance Down II debuff. Living Liquid will cast three sets of Protean Waves.
For the first set, Living Liquid will cast 8 telegraphed Protean Waves toward every player, the one targeting the main tank will repeat during the two next sets!
The second and third sets will only target 4 players with an instant Protean Wave. But due to the Water Resistance Down II debuff, it is impossible to get hit by these two sets. 4 players need to take the second set and the 4 others need to take the third.

Sluice:
Telegraphed AoE targeting the 4 furthest players. Happen during the second set of Protean Waves.

Splash:
Series of 6 consecutive magical raidwide attacks.

Drainage:
Two tethers from two tornadoes that will inflict a magical AoE tank buster around the tethered player after 5 seconds. Need to be picked up by the tanks.
Tip: when the tethers appear, the tornadoes scan for targets from the South to the North of the arena (cardinals based on the tornadoes) and will give the tethers to the two first players found. If both tanks are the Southest players, they will automatically get the tethers.

Throttle:
Debuff inflicted on 6 random players that last 10 seconds. Need to be dispelled before it revolves or the bearer will die.

After Cascade, Living Liquid is tanked between the South and West tornadoes while the hand is pulled apart. Once the hand is baited, the hand joins LL. Vac voke the hand to LD both tank busters. Aki takes the hands back afterward.
Doll pickup: Biscuit: SW, Eresh: NE, Nana: SE, Skye: NW.
The tanks go back mid while Biscuit and Skye are feeding. Double cleave. Eresh and Nana are feeding.
Protean Waves 1:


Protean Waves 2:


Living Liquid and Liquid Hand are already apart for Hand of Prayer. Rejoin on the NW-ish to evade the Embolus orbs.

<h1><a id="Limit Cut">Limit Cut</a></h1>

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<h2>Abilities Breakdown</h2>

Cruise Chaser will be untargetable during the whole transition.

Optical Sight:
One-hit-kill AoEs circles that strike at cardinal or intercardinal positions on opposite sides of the arena. (If one strikes North, it will also strike South at the same time). Strikes the arena four times in a row while rotating clockwise from the original position (ie. one set will strike N->NE->E->SE and the other S->SW->W->NW), a fifth AoE will hit the center of the arena.
It will repeat one more time, the second set of Optical Sights will resume their rotation from where the first set stopped.

Alpha Sword: 
Conal AoE that inflicts a Physical Vulnerability Up debuff and does a slight Knockback. Knockback immunity can be used.

Super Blasty Charge:
Dash that inflicts a Physical Vulnerability Up debuff and does a massive Knockback if the player doesn’t look at Cruise Chaser. Knockback immunity can be used.

Limit Cut:
Players are marked with dots, numbered from 1 to 8, indicating the order in which Cruise Chase will strike. Odd numbered players are marked with blue dots while even numbered players are marked with red dots.
Cruise Chaser will teleport behind the next odd numbered player and use Alpha Sword. Then he will use Super Blasty Charge toward the next even numbered player.
Cruise Chaser will repeat this for every pair of numbers.

</div>

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<h2>Strategy</h2>

The Easiest Limit Cut:
After the first explosion, one group (with numbers 1, 2, 5 and 6) go to the North or East, and the other group (3, 4, 7 and 8) go South or West.
Everyone follows the AoEs. For each group, the next duo to be attacked runs in the inner ring and the other duo runs in the outer ring. Odd numbered players face the next AoE in front of him to not cleave anyone and the even numbered player faces his duo mate.
Once a duo is hit, swap your ring position with the other duo.
Rinse and repeat
(You can stop moving after the 3rd AoE of the second set)

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<h2><a id="Brute Justice & Cruise ChaserAbilities Breakdown">Abilities Breakdown</a></h2>


J-Kick:
High raidwide damage at the beginning of the phase from Brute Justice. Brute Justice will spawn on the West of the arena while Cruise Chaser will spawn on the East side.

Whirlwind:
Raidwide damage from Cruise Chaser.

Judgement Nisi:
Applies Final Decree Nisi debuffs to either the DPS, or tanks/healers. Each player receives a different debuff: α (alpha, Blue), β (beta, Red), γ (gamma, Purple) or δ (delta, Green). Nisi debuffs deal small damage over time and last 35 seconds. 
If one player touches another player with no Nisi, the debuff spreads to that player with its full duration. If two players with different Nisi debuffs touch each other, they die. We need to keep the Nisi debuff “alive” by passing it to others in order to resolve Gavel later.

Link-Up:
Applies Compressed Lightning on a DPS, and Compressed Water on a healer. Both debuffs last 30 seconds. Summon two Steam Chakram.

Compressed Water:
Debuff which lasts 30 seconds that, when it resolves, deals damage shared between the players caught in the AoE.
Compressed Water debuff is then passed onto one player that shared the damage. The player who had the debuff when it exploded will receive a Water Resistance Down II afterward.
A tornado will spawn at the explosion location. If you stand inside you’ll be tethered to it and die and it will wipe the group if it is left alone for too long. The tornado can be transformed into an ice block with Ice Missile or removed with Flamethrower.
Compressed Water is removed by a suCruise Chaseressful Gavel.

Compressed Lightning:
Debuff which lasts 30 seconds that, when it resolves, deals damage shares with another player and only one. If more than one player is stacked with, the group will wipe.
Compressed Lightning debuff is then passed to the player that shared the damage. The player who had the debuff when it exploded will receive a Lightning Resistance Down II afterward. 
Compressed Lightning is removed by a suCruise Chaseressful Gavel

Steam Chakram:
2 chakrams will spawn outside of the arena. Each chakram will cast Eye of the Chakram at a random player and will fire across the arena. The whole group can stack in the middle of the arena to bait their trajectories so they go through the middle.
Tip: the chakrams will appear in the enemy list with Eye of the Chakram cast bar

Optical Sight:
AoEs under everyone when the chakrams are casting Eye of the Chakram.

Photon:
Set HP to 1 for the whole team on the first cast, only tanks are affected on the second cast.

Spin Crusher:
Frontal cleave by Cruise Chaser. Has a cast time and can be avoided by going to its sides.

Missile Command:
Brute Justice will cast Ice Missile, Earth Missiles, Enumeration, and Hidden Mine.

Earth missiles:
Puddle AoEs on the 2 furthest players from Brute Justice, the puddle will stay for a short amount of time. Standing inside will give a high damaging dot.

Hidden Mine:
Mines on the ground that appear just after Earth Missiles on the same players. Need to be popped off by a tank. After a moment they explode and wipe the group.

Ice Missile:
A targeted AoE on a tank that leaves an ice puddle behind that will grow in size after a few seconds. It must be placed next to the Compressed Water tornado to freeze it and create an ice block for Propeller Wind.

Enumeration:
An orb and a number appear on top of two DPS with a circle around them. The exact number of players should stand inside or the group will wipe. For this fight the number is always 3.

Verdict:
Applies Final Judgement: Penalty III debuffs on every one that requires three debuffs with “Final”.
Also applies Final Judgment: Decree Nisi α, β, γ or δ. This debuff determines which Nisi debuff you must have for Gavel. Once Verdict is casted, you won’t spread your debuff with your partner but with the Nisi you require.
These debuffs will be removed by a suCruise Chaseressful Gavel. 

Limit Cut:
Cruise Chaser becomes invulnerable and creates a Plasma Shield that can only be damaged from the front. The shield has around 120k HP and lasts 6 seconds. If the shield isn’t destroyed in time, Cruise Chaser will gain a Damage Up buff and will wipe the group at the next Whirlwind.

Flamethrower:
Tank buster cleave aimed at the closest person of Brute Justice. Must be aimed toward the second Compressed Water tornado to remove it. Apply Fire Resistance Down II debuff.

Propeller Wind:
Cruise Chaser will cast a raidwide AoE that inflicts a Confuse debuff. Break LoS with the ice block created with the Missile Command to avoid it. Take care to not spread your Nisi debuff to others.

Gavel:
Will resolve all Final Judgement debuffs and the requirements must be met or it will cause a wipe. Also remove the ice block, the remaining tornado, Decree Nisi debuffs, Compressed Water and Compressed Lightning. FREEDOM

Double Rocket Punch:
Physical tank buster on Brute Justice tank that needs to be shared.

Super Jump:
Brute Justice jumps and inflicts physical damage on the furthest player from Brute Justice.

Apocalyptic Ray:
Instant lethal cone targeting the furthest player. Medium range, it can be avoided with enough distance using Super Jump.

Eternal Darkness + Final Sentence : Enrage. If one boss is killed, the other will cast its enrage.

</div>

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<h2><a id="Brute Justice & Cruise ChaserStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

After Limit Cut, regroup mid and heal for the incoming J-Kick followed by Whirlwind.

Brute Justice will cast Judgement Nisi, giving Nisi debuffs to the DPSs or the tanks/healers. From that moment, do not touch anyone except to your partner during the specified “Nisi Pass”. There will be 4 “Nisi Pass” during the phase. 
Brute Justice will also cast Link Up and will put a Compressed Lightning on a DPS, and Compressed Water on a healer. These two debuffs will resolve 3 times during the phase.

Regroup mid (without touching each other) to bait the chakrams so they go through the middle of the arena. Once they start casting Eye of the Chakram, move to the edge of the arena to dodge them. 


While dodging the chakrams, Cruise Chaser will cast Optical Sight, placing an AoE under everyone. 
So everyone spreads to the edge to not be in the path of the chakrams, and once the chakrams are done, go back mid (without touching each other), the Optical Sight AoEs will explode on the edge of the arena where everyone previously was.



Cruise Chaser will cast Photon which will bring everyone’s HP to 1. Use SuCruise Chaseror or Shake to put a shield so the small dot from the nisi debuffs won’t kill anyone.

First Nisi Pass: the best way to pass nisi is that the player with the nisi debuff stand still and the one without come take it (the best one)
In the case displayed below, Aki should stand still while Biscuit moves toward Aki to get it. Repeat for every pair.


Cruise Chaser will cast Spin Crusher, a telegraphed frontal cleave. Cruise Chaser tank turns Cruise Chaser away before dodging to the side.

First Compressed Debuffs. Compressed Lightning and Compressed Water will resolve. 
As Compressed Water leaves a tornado that needs to be put at a specific position and that the debuff is randomly passed, tanks usually don’t take part with this debuff to not drag the bosses everywhere or be in complicated situations.Since tanks do not interact with Compressed Water, they take care of Compressed Lightning. 

The DPS with the Compressed Lightning will share with the Brute Justice tank.
In order to have an easy Compressed Lightning we share like this: DPS shares with Brute Justice tank => Brute Justice tank shares with the healer from 1st Compressed Water => the healer shares with Cruise Chaser tank.
The position of the Compressed Water debuffs will be : North > South > South 
So the healer with Compressed Water goes North and shares the damage with as many people as possible (min. 3 with good mitigation) and quickly leave the newborn tornado to not die. Remember to not touch each other.


Now Brute Justice will cast Missile Command that will target the two furthest players with Earth Missile (Earth Puddle + Hidden Mines), a random tank with Ice Missile (ice puddle), and two random DPS with enumeration (always 3 players required).
Since Brute Justice is on the West side, Earth Missile will be baited on Cruise Chaser side, the Cruise Chaser tank and another healer can bait the puddle and the hidden mine. They will first bait the puddle along the edge, then move toward the center to drop the mines. The mines need to be popped quickly by the Cruise Chaser tank afterward.
The Ice Missile needs to be placed near the North tornado to transform the tornado into an ice block useful later. The dropped puddle will grow in size so no need to put it on top of the tornado. If the Cruise Chaser tank gets the Ice Missile, drop it before taking out the mines.
The Enumeration has to use a priority system such as this exemple:
Brute Justice < NIN < BRD < SMN < BLM < Cruise Chaser where the first DPS on the list who get Enumeration will stack near Brute Justice with the two free DPS while the second DPS with Enumeration will stack near Cruise Chaser with the healers.




Second Nisi Pass: same as before, the player with the nisi debuff stands still while his mate picks it.

Second Compressed Debuffs. The healer from the 1st Compressed Water
shares with Brute Justice tank who gots Compressed  Lightning. 
The Compressed Water player will go South-West-ish and stack with the available players (no tanks, no Compressed Lightning , no Water Resistance Down). This new tornado will soon be removed by Brute Justice.
Cruise Chaser tank needs to turn Cruise Chaser toward the center of the arena for the upcoming mechanic.    



Brute Justice will now cast Verdict that tells you which Nisi debuff you must have for Gavel. From now on, you won’t pass nisi like previously but based on Final Judgement: Decree Nisi. More details at the third “Nisi Pass”.

Cruise Chaser will cast Limit Cut, everyone will be numbered from 1 to 8 and I’m joking. Cruise Chaser will become invulnerable and spawn a Plasma Shield in front of him. The shield can only be damaged from the front, has 120k HP and needs to be killed in ~6 seconds. 
Cruise Chaser tank and another DPS should have enough damage but others can throw some attacks if needed.
Meanwhile, Brute Justice will cast Flamethrower. The tank must aim the attack toward the South tornado to remove it. In order for Flamethrower to be casted at the right player, only the Brute Justice tank should stand inside its hitbox.


Third Nisi Pass: players with a Nisi debuff will form a line between Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser. Then the players without a Nisi will pick the one requested by Final Judgement: Decree Nisi. Take your time to not touch each other.

Tip: if the DPSs are the one with the Nisi, they can form the line during the Flamethrower/Limit Cut mechanic.

Cruise Chaser will cast Whirlwind acting as a heal check for next Compressed debuffs.

Third Compressed Debuffs. The healer with Compressed Lightning shares with the Cruise Chaser tank. Compressed Water stack South to put the tornado away from the center freeing some space for the group.



The Cruise Chaser tank must move Cruise Chaser North behind the Ice Block before it casts Propeller Wind where we need to break the line of sight with Cruise Chaser. The players with Nisi will form a line South of the Ice Block.
Forth Nisi Pass happens at the same time. The players without Nisi will stack with the player corresponding to your Final Judgement: Decree Nisi.
Brute Justice will immediately cast Gavel so stay stacked with your duo until Gavel is done, that way if you debuff expired just before Gavel cast is over, you will immediately get your Nisi debuff back.


The tanks will move North-East-ish to be afflicted by Photon followed by Double Rocket Punch that needs to be shared. The rest of the group will move behind Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser (North-West ish) except a ranged that will stay mid to bait the incoming mechanic.


Super Jump will target the furthest player (the ranged mid) that will move as South as possible. After the landing, Brute Justice will turn toward the furthest player and cast Apocalyptic Ray which should be out of range to kill anyone.


Then Whirlwind will be casted twice followed by the enrage Eternal Darkness + Final Sentence.

<h2><a id="Alexander PrimeAbilities Breakdown">Abilities Breakdown</a></h2>


Temporal Stasis:
Alexander Prime will inflict the following debuffs when the cast time starts:
House Arrest : one Tank/Healer and one DPS will be tethered. These players must be close to each other when the effect resolves.
Restraining Order : one Tank/Healer and one DPS will be tethered. These players must be far from each other when the effect resolves.
Aggravated Assault : on one Tank/Healer and one DPS. Players with this debuff cannot take any more damage or they die. Deals damage when the effect resolves and gives a Physical and a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff.
One Tank/Healer and one DPS won’t have any debuffs.
Once Temporal Stasis is completed, time will stop (and your buff timer too). The debuffs will be resolved then Brute Justice will cast Flamethrower toward the two closest targets and Cruise Chaser will cast Alpha Sword toward the three closest targets.


Chastening Heat:
A magical tank buster on the main target that inflicts a Magic Vulnerability Down debuff for 4 seconds.

Divine Spear:
Magical cleave on the main target that follows Chastening Heat.

Inception Formation
Aetheroplasm:
Four plasma orbs will be tethered to four random players. They will slowly move toward their player and explode on contact with any player. Their size will decrease over time as well as their damage (named Tetrashatter).
After exploding, they will leave a puddle on the ground, inflicting Heavy to anyone inside. If two puddles overlap, it will wipe the group.

Judgement Crystal:
Four random players are targeted by AoE markers that will drop a Judgment Crystal. The area around Judgment Crystals inflicts a bleed debuff. If a Judgment Crystal explodes, it will deal based-proximity damage.
The Judgment Crystal will explode if:
Two Judgement Crystals overlap,
It is close to Alexander Prime during Inception,
The True Heart is at the intersection of the Judgment Crystals.

True Heart:
Add spawned by Shanoa that will move toward Alexander Prime, if it reaches Alexander Prime, he will wipe the group. 
However this is the hidden mechanic of the fight. When it intersects with the four Judgement Crystal, it will become golden and move toward Alexander prime position for the incoming Inception. It will also grant you the Enigma Codex buff that allows you to realise the Fate Calibrations in the last phase.

Inception:
Alexander prime will teleport and cast Sacrament while inflicting the following debuffs at the beginning of the cast:
Restraining Order : on one Tank and one DPS.
Aggravated Assault : on two DPS.
Shared Sentence: on one DPS. Act as a share marker when the effect resolves and gives a Physical and a Magic Vulnerability Up debuff to anyone sharing the damage.

Sacrament:
Line AoE from Alexander Prime cardinals. One-shot anyone caught.


Wormhole Formation
Link-Up:
Summon two Steam Chakram. Do not apply any kind of debuff here.

Void Of Repentance:
Alexander Prime will summon two puddles on the eastern and western side (to the opposite of each other) of the arena. Each puddle must be soaked by one player, reducing its size. It will disappear after the third soak.
Soaking a Void of Repentance puddle will Inflict damage and give a Magic Vulnerability Up and a Vulnerability Up debuffs. If not soaked, it will wipe the raid.

Incinerating Heat:
Stack marker on a random player inflicting heavy damage.

Summon Alexander
Mega Holy: 
Heavy magical raid-wide damage. Required shields and mitigation.

J Storm:
High raid-wide damage when Brute Justice appears.

J Wave:
Bruce Justice soft enrage, dealing raid-wide damage, giving him a Damage Up buff each cast. It will wipe the group if he reaches 14 stacks.

Divine Judgement:
Alexander Prime’s enrage. Extremely long cast time (more than 1 min).

</div>

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<h2><a id="Alexander PrimeStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

<a id="STemporal Stasis"></a>Alexander Prime will appear to the North of the arena while Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser will randomly appear to the East and West of the center. 
SO THE EXAMPLE BELOW CAN BE MIRRORED EAST-WEST.

In order to simplify where to go, follow these rules:
Tanks/Healers are always on the North Side. DPS are always on the South side.
Players with House Arrest are on Cruise Chaser, close to the center of the Cruise Chaser hitbox.
The Tank with Restraining Order is on the open side of Cruise Chaser (midway between the edge and Cruise Chaser) while the DPS with Restraining Order is near the edge on Brute Justice side.
Players without debuff are on Brute Justice, inside its hitbox to avoid any mistarget.
Players with Aggravated Assault are near the edge on Brute Justice side.

When Temporal Stasis is casted, House Arrest and Restraining Order will resolve. Then Brute Justice will use Flamethrower on the players without debuff while Cruise Chaser will use Alpha Sword on the House Arrest players and the Restraining Order tank.

Chastening Spear
Alexander Prime will appear in the middle and will cast Chastening Heat on the main tank followed by 3 Divine Spear. It will happen twice in the third phase.
Due to invulnerability duration, only the 3 Divine Spear can be invuln through. That means that the tank must survive the initial Chastening Heat and the next auto-attack before using his invulnerability.
=> However for this Chastening Spear, the delay between Chastening Heat and Divine Spear is shorter than for the next Chastening Spear (one auto-attack instead of two). Meaning that PLD and DRK can use Hallowed Ground and Living Dead to survive all 4 hits.

<a id="SInception Formation"></a>Alexander Prime will spawn to the North or South, Shanoa will spawn on the opposite side of Alexander Prime and Brute Justice will always spawn to the West. Wherever Alexander Prime spawned is considered True North.

For the 8 next diagrams, let's consider that Alexander Prime spawned North
Four randoms players will be tethered to Aetheroplasm orbs while the four others will get the Judgement Crystal marker.
Two orbs will spawn on the East  side and two others of the West side. Tethered players will drag their orbs across the arena to reduce their damage and bring them on the North side along the edge. In the beginning, start dragging your orb near Alexander so it won’t go through players in the South.
Once their orbs have exploded, the players move under Alexander Prime.
The marked players will take positions to the South as shown below. Then move North when the markers are off.



Here is the Judgment Crystals positions for both cases:


At the same time, next to Shanoa, will spawn the True Heart (looks like that titan-egi child that 
nobody wanted) that will move toward Alexander Prime and will detonate the Judgement Crystals on its way, dealing proximity-based damages.
While the Judgement Crystals explode, the group and especially the tanks will rotate toward Brute Justice.


Brute Justice will now use Flamethrower on the three closest targets in a succession. The first tank will take the first Flamethrower toward the middle of the arena so melees can then jump back to the True Heart. The second tank will aim the second Flamethrower toward the South, while someone from the rest of the group will bait the last one toward the group North.
Dealing damage to the True Heart has no importance except building gauge, getting bard’s procs or other things.



Alexander Prime will start casting Inception, giving debuffs to players. When the cast is over, Alexander Prime will teleport away and the True Heart will move toward the edge of the arena telling us where Alexander Prime will reappear and cast Sacrament.
The tanks and the DPS with Shared Sentence will stack on the left edge while facing Alexander Prime while the rest of the group will stack on the right edge. Sacrament is automatically avoided and the debuffs resolved properly.
    

When the debuffs resolve, Cruise Chaser will spawn in the middle while Brute Justice is still on the West edge. Cruise Chaser will cast Alpha Sword on the three closest players and Brute Justice will cast Super Jump on the furthest player.
The DPS who had Restraining Order will go West and both healers will go North and South of Cruise Chaser to bait the Alpha Swords. The rest of the group will stack on the East side close to Cruise Chaser but not as much as the baiters.
Meanwhile, one tank goes on the East edge and bait Super Jump. After the third Alpha Sword, the East group can move inside Cruise Chaser hitbox to be sure to avoid the Super Jump aoe damage.


Chastening Spear

Same as the previous one, use the invuln after the first auto-attack following Chastening Heat. 
Take a look at your tank’s anus being enlarged. Here is a picture of it:

<a id="SWormhole Formation"></a>Alexander Prime will spawn South while Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser will spawn randomly on North East or North West.
Let’s consider that Brute Justice spawned NW and Cruise Chaser spawned NE for the following diagrams: 

Cruise Chaser will cast Limit Cut, assigning a number to everyone and Brute Justice will cast Link Up, summoning two Steam Chakrams to the cardinals next to Brute Justice. 
The whole group will move under Brute Justice to bait them. Once the Steam Chakrams have their target, everyone will move to their position according to their number.



During this part, odd numbers (1,3,5,7) will always be on the West side of the arena while the even numbers (2,4,6,8) will be on the East side. Depending of your numbers, the Alpha Sword or Super Blasty Charge will ALWAYS be baited on the red dot located at these inter-cardinals:
North West : 1 & 5        =>            North East : 2 & 6

South West : 3 & 7        =>            South East : 4 & 8
USE YOUR KNOCKBACK IMMUNITY WHEN GETTING HIT BY LIMIT CUT
ODD NUMBER FACING THE EDGE AND EVEN NUMBER FACING THEIR PARTNER 

Due to the fact that getting hit by Limit Cut and soaking a Void of Repentance gives Vulnerability Down debuffs, the puddles need to be soaked by these numbers:
    1st puddle      →    5 & 6
    2nd puddle     →    7 & 8
    3rd puddle      →    1 & 2


While the Steam Chakrams are casting, Alexander Prime will spawn two Void of Repentance puddles on the east and west side, opposite to each other. Numbers 5 & 6 should stand inside, ready to soak it and 7 & 8 should be on the red dots of their side, considered as a safe spot.
For this example the puddles are W-NW and E-SE, but it can also be E-NE and W-SW (aka mirrored East-West).
11

The Steam Chakrams will go off and the first pair will receive Limit Cut. At the same time, Brute Justice will use Super Jump on the furthest player, opposite of where Brute Justice spawned. 



The next Limit Cut pair happens and Brute Justice will cast Apocalyptic Ray towards the furthest player. The Void of Repentance puddle will also explode for the first time. Once they soak, 5 & 6 move North while 7 & 8 now stand inside the puddles.
To avoid Apocalyptic Ray, the player targeted by Brute Justice’s jump (numbered 3 or 4) should stand in front of the red dot and once Brute Justice has jumped, move onto the red dot to avoid the ray and be in position for his own Limit Cut (check the previous pictures).
Furthermore, the player numbered 1 or 2 that was under Brute Justice must stay on the red dot until Brute Justice uses Apocalyptic Ray to avoid targeting someone else.


Alexander Prime will finish casting Sacrement. The third Limit Cut pair will happen and the Void of Repentance will explode for the second time. 7 & 8 will move South once they have soaked, and are replaced by 1 & 2 for the last soak.a


The final part of Limit Cut will happen as well as the last Void of Repentance explosion.


Everyone then regroup and stack mid for Incinerating Heat. Brute Justice will also cast Missile Command targeting two DPS with Enumeration. Use the same priority system as the one used during Bruce Chustice phase (3 dps left, 1dps + 2 Healers right, tanks out). Meanwhile, tanks will move North to get ready for when Alexander Prime will reappear.
Summon Alexander

Alexander Prime will cast 2 Mega Holy that need to be mitigated.

Then he will disappear and reappear with Brute Justice (arriving with J Storm) and Cruise Chaser. Brute Justice will cast its soft enrage, J Wave that needs to be mitigated through this part while Alexander Prime and Cruise Chaser will cast their respecting hard enrages.
Cruise Chaser needs to be killed first since its enrage, Eternal Darkness, is the fastest.
Next one is Brute Justice and finally Alexander. 
(Healers may need to switch to full heal after the 7-8th J Wave.)

LB3 and shields are needed to survive Divine Judgement when Alexander Prime is killed.

Final Word: Perfect Alexander will apply the following debuffs:
Contact Regulation : on one player. Called “light beacon”.
Contact Prohibition : on three players. When the debuff resolves, the players will automatically move toward the player with Contact Regulation . If they touch this player, they die. Can easily be recognized by the arrow under the buff and called “light follower”.
Escape Detection : on one player. Called “dark beacon”.
Escape Prohibition : on three players. When the debuff resolves, the players will automatically move away from the player with Escape Detection . If they touch or run too far away from this player, they die. Can easily be recognized by the arrow under the buff and called “dark follower”.
Tip: “followers” always have an arrow on their debuff since they’ll move while the “beacon” doesn’t have one since they’ll stay static.

Ordained Motion: Every player must be moving at the end of the cast or they will die. Denoted by a light sword.

Ordained Stillness: Every player must be standing still and not attacking the boss at the end of the cast or they will die. Denoted by a dark sword.

Optical Sight: One of these two mechanics will be casted:
Collective Reprobation: Stack markers on two players. One player from the light group and one player from the dark group will be selected. Denoted by the two orbs to Perfect Alexander sides.
Individual Reprobation: AoE markers on every player. Denoted by the multiples orbs next to Perfect Alexander.

Fate Projection: Fate Projections always precede Fate Calibrations. 
During the cast, Perfect Alexander will prepare every mechanic you will receive during the Fate Calibrations. However these mechanics will be unknown for each player and they will resolve immediately during Fate Calibration.
In order to know which mechanics will happen, Enigma Codex will come into play. During Fate Projection, Enigma Codex will create a clone for every player. Each player will have an arrow (compass like) pointing towards their clone. Every mechanic that the player’s clone suffers during Fate Projection will happen to that player during the incoming Fate Calibration.

Fate Calibration ⍺: 
First mechanic: will be either Ordained Motion/Stillness for everyone depending on the sword colour.
Second Mechanic:
Defamation on one player. Denoted by the huge explosion.
Shared Sentence on one player. Denoted by the large cog:

Aggravated Assault on three players. Denoted by the small cog:

Nothing on three players.
Third mechanic: will be either Ordained Motion/Stillness for everyone depending on the sword colour.
Fourth mechanic: Four Alexanders will appear on the North side. Three of them will cast Sacrement, leaving a safe spot where the fourth should have cast.

Ordained Capital Punishment: A three-hit magical tank buster on the main target that can be shared with the other tank. Always followed by Ordained Punishment.

Ordained Punishment: Heavy magical tank buster on the main target. Inflict a Physical Vulnerability Up for 30 seconds. Since Perfect Alexander’s auto-attack deals physical damage, a swap is required.

Fate Calibration ꞵ: 
First mechanic: will be Final Words with Alexander debuffs.
Light debuff on four players:
Contact Regulation: on one player. Denoted by this player’s clone not moving and staying close to the edge of the arena.
Contact Prohibition: on three players. Each player will receive one of these: House Arrest, Restraining Order and Shared Sentence.
Dark debuff on four players:
Escape Detection: on one player. Denoted by this player’s clone not moving and staying close to the edge of the arena.
Escape Prohibition: on three players. Two players will receive one of these: House Arrest, Restraining Order.
Second Mechanic: Four Alexanders will appear on the North side. Three of them will cast Super Jump, three players need to bait the jump on the East, West and South cardinals.
Third mechanic: will be either Optical Sight. Collective/Individual Reprobation will be decided depending on the orbs around Perfect Alexander.
Fourth mechanic: One of the Alexanders that jumped will cast Radiant Sacrament.

Almighty Judgment: Perfect Alexander will show three sets of AoE, dealing no damage. They will be repeated during the cast of Irresistible Grace and will inflict lethal damage if hit. These AoEs need to be avoided as a group.

Irresistible Grace: A stack marker on a random player. Deals huge magical damage.

Temporal Interference: Perfect Alexander soft enrage. Perfect Alexander will summon 7 Temporal Prisons located on the 7 circles around the center of the arena. For each prison, a player must be locked inside until the boss is defeated. The group will wipe soon after the seventh prison.
The prisons will spawn in a clockwise manner, starting on the North East.

<h2><a id="Perfect AlexanderStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

Since you may enter this phase with your resources being full (mana + gauge), I recommend to check The Balance/Akhmorning for any specific opener.

Pre Fate Calibration
Perfect Alexander will appear in the middle of the arena with its aggro meter being reset. Your first potion should be popped here.
He will cast Final Word, allocating a debuff to everyone. Immediately move to your assigned position:

Here, dark and light followers have been separated for a better understanding but they should stack together.

While moving to your position and before the debuffs resolve, he will cast either Ordained Motion or Ordained Stillness. When the cast reaches 50%, keep/stop moving as requested.

The Final Word debuffs will resolve and Perfect Alexander will cast another Ordained Motion or Ordained Stillness at the same time and it will be the opposite of the first one.
Both groups of followers will move toward the light beacon.
When the forced march from Final Word is over, Ordained Motion/Stillness cast time will be at 50%, so immediately keep/stop moving as requested.

Next, Perfect Alexander will cast Optical Sight, either spread or stack. 
If it ends up being stack markers, the players who had a dark debuff will stack on the South side of Perfect Alexander while the players who had a light debuff will stack on its North side.

<a id="SFate Calibration ⍺"></a>Perfect Alexander will start casting Fate Calibration. Players should follow their clone and need to pay attention if they receive Defamation or Aggravated Assault. Since the other debuffs are automatically resolved.

The two Ordained Motion/Stillness and Sacrement safe spots can be called by one player.

When it comes to position to solve the mechanic, the player with Defamation will head to the North safe spot under the Perfect Alexander that didn’t fire.
Meanwhile the rest of the group will move to the South safe spot. Players with Aggravated Assault will stack on the right while the rest will stack on the left. 

This is the result when the debuffs will resolve after the sacraments will fire:

If the “NW” and “SE” are safe 


If the “NE” and “SW” are safe

Here is a better view for each side (you can use the arena and markers as landmark):


When Perfect Alexander disappears, players should already be at their designated position and ready to do the first Ordained Motion/Stillness.
The three Sacraments, the debuffs and the second Ordained Motion/Stillness will resolve at the same time.
The same Ordained Motion/Stillness can happen twice in a row here.
Punishments
Perfect Alexander will cast Ordained Capital Punishment that needs to be share between both tanks, followed by Ordained Punishment requiring a swap during the cast.
Paladin and Dark Knight can use they invuln on all four hits, while Warrior and Gunbreak can only invuln three hits.

<a id="SFate Calibration ꞵ"></a>Perfect Alexander will start casting Fate Calibration. Players should follow their clone and need to pay attention if they’re a dark/light beacon/follower. If you’re a dark follower, check if you received Restraining Order or no debuff. Since the other debuffs are automatically resolved.

The two Optical Sight and Radiant Sacrement safe spots can be called by one player.

Once you know your debuff, take the following position:

The light beacon will go North while the rest will be East. 
The dark beacon will stay along the edge behind everyone.
The dark follower with Restraining Order will aim to be forced to march toward the South.
The dark follower without other debuff with aim to be forced to march toward the West.
The other players will aim to be forced to march toward the light beacon.

When the forced march is over, players to the East, South and West have to walk into the cardinal to bait the Super Jumps. And the group North will stack together:

All the debuffs will resolve at the same time as the Super Jumps.

Following that will be Optical Sight: 
Stack: the players who had a dark debuff will stack on the South side of Perfect Alexander while the players who had a light debuff will stack on its North side.
Spread: dark players will stay at their cardinal position while the light player will spread around the center of the arena.

Once Optical Sight is done, run to the Perfect Alexander that will use Radiant Sacrament. You can keep Sprint in order to run faster and be safe.

Punishments
Same as before.
Almighty Grace
Perfect Alexander will cast Almighty Judgment. The three set of AoE will use the patterns bellow:

The solution here is to move into the third set of AoE and then step into the first set once it’s done. 
For example, if the set is: Yellow > Blue > Red. Everyone will stand at C, then move to D once the Yellow AoEs happen.

When the last set of Almighty Judgment explodes, Irresistible Grace cast will be completed, needing at least 20% mitigation + shields. Since Irresistible Grace and the next Irresistible Grace are the last raid-wide damage abilities, it can be over mitigated.
Punishments
Same as before.
Almighty Grace
Same as before. This Irresistible Grace doesn’t need to be healed since there is no more raid-wide damage afterwards, allowing the healer to focus on dps.
Pop your second potion after the Irresistible Grace. LB3 can be used anytime from now on.
Temporal Interference
Perfect Alexander soft enrage begins. The order for the prisons should be:
1 : SCH
2 : WHM
3 : WAR/DRK depending on the burst left
4 : WAR/DRK
5 : BRD
6 : NIN
7 : BLM/SMN
