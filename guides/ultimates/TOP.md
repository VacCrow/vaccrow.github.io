+ **<u>Hello World</u>:**

___

Hello, World #1 - raid-wide damage accompanied by various debuffs that need to be handled in specific ways.
Overflow + Synchronization - all 8 second duration debuffs will detonate first. Players need to coordinate themselves into safe spots to avoid (or intentionally take) damage from exploding players, remembering that Synch (medium) explosions need to be soaked by an additional player each.
Latent Defect - 10-second duration debuffs detonate, slaying anyone who has not removed them by taking damage.
Synchronization - 12 second duration debuffs will detonate.
Re-Applied Debuffs - Variable depending on how the raid decided to handle the above.
Critical Error - inflicts raid-wide damage and applies Critical Overflow Bug to anyone who doesn't have Debugger.
Archive Peripheral - rotating beams from mechanical arms, forcing the raid to locate the only safe spot that will be formed.

Index & Archive Peripherals - mechanical arms tether to random players and prepare to fire straight-line AoE's at them.
Wave Cannon - Omega prepares to shoot straight-line AoE's at the closest players. Raid forms a star-pattern by having non-tethered targets stand near the boss (in-between tethered targets, who stand at the outer edges of the arena, opposite their respective arms).

Archive All - creates mechanical arms around the outer edge of the platform that will begin to cast Colossal Blow. Players will need to destroy one as soon as possible to create a safe spot. Simultaneously, a rotating straight-line AoE will repeatedly fire while slowly twisting in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion.
Electric Slide - Omega turns in a specific direction and charges, inflicting proximity-based damage when it collides with the edge of the arena. All players should be focusing on a mechanical arm in the opposite direction of where Omega is about to charge.
Delta Attack - marks one player with a stack-marker, four players with circle-AoE's, and causes most of the raid to drop circle AoE's beneath their feet. Players must dodge the floor circles, spread out their circle AoE's, and soak the stack marker whilst also destroying their chosen mechanical arm AND avoiding the rotating beam. Colossal Blow concludes after Delta Attack, wiping the raid if the chosen arm wasn't destroyed in time.

Hello, World #2 - raid wide damage accompanied by various debuffs, just like before, except for a new debuff (Critical Underflow Bug) and three soakable light-pillars (Cascading Latent Defect).
Cascading Latent Defect - forms three light-pillars in a straight line through the arena centre that can only be soaked by players affected by Critical Underflow Bug. Failure to soak a tower results in a wipe. Success inflicts Latent Defect on the soaker.
Critical Error - inflicts raid-wide damage and applies Critical Overflow Bug to anyone who doesn't have Debugger.
