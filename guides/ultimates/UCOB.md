<h2><a id="TwintaniaAbilities Breakdown">Abilities Breakdown</a></h2>

When *Twintania* health reaches specifics thresholds, respectively at 75%, 45% and 0%, she will drop a **Neurolink** under her hitbox. Standing inside a **Neurolink** will give you the <span class="speDebuff">Neurolink</span> debuff, slowing you down, reducing your healing and greatly reducing your damage done.

___

+ **<ins>Plumet</ins>:** Non telegraphed cleave tank buster on the main target dealing <span class="phys">physical damage</span>.

___

+ **<ins>Twister</ins>:** At the end of the cast, small tornados will be placed under 4 random players. If someone steps on it, it will kill that player and knock back any close player into the wall, thus killing them.

___

+ **<ins>Fireball</ins>:** A random DPS or Healers will be marked with a red marker. After a few second, *Twintania* will hurl a fireball at that player, dealing <span class="magic">magical damage</span> that can be shared. At least 6 players are needed in the stack.

___

+ **<ins>Death Sentence</ins>:** Tank buster on the main target dealing **slashing** <span class="phys">physical damage</span> and applying a <span class="debuff">Slashing Resistance Down II</span> debuff for 34 seconds. Requires a tank swap since *Twintania* auto-attacks are slashing type.

___

+ **<ins>Liquid Hell</ins>:** *Twintania* will target a random player that is beyond a specific range. She will attack 5 times and each attack will leave a fire puddle lasting 15 seconds. Standing inside a puddle will kill any player. In order for the 5 hits to be aimed at the right player, make sure that only that player is away from *Twintania*.  
Once the second **Neurolink** is dropped, the **Liquid Hell** may also target a second player randomly for all 5 hits except the main Tank.

___

+ **<ins>Generate</ins>:** A random DPS will be marked with a purple marker (with three orbs linked together and rotating) and a **Hatch** (a purple aetherical sphere) will appear under *Twintania*. This **Hatch** will slowly move toward the marked player.  
If the player isn't standing or didn't have the <span class="speDebuff">Neurolink</span> debuff, it will deal (lethal) <span class="magic">magical damage</span> and apply a <span class="debuff">Damage Down</span> debuff on the whole group.  
If the player is standing **AND** have the <span class="speDebuff">Neurolink</span> debuff, it will deal <span class="magic">magical damage</span> and apply a <span class="speDebuff">Mana Hypersensitivity</span> debuff lasting 15 seconds that make any **Hatch** dealing lethal <span class="magic">magical damage</span>. If another player is caught in the **Hatch** explosion, it will kill him.  
Once the second **Neurolink** is dropped, **Generate** will also target a second DPS and create another **Hatch**. These **Hatch** need to be soaked in two different **Neurolink**.

___

+ **<ins>Aetheric Profusion</ins>:**
Enrage. Happens after the second **Fireball** or **Death Sentence** when the second **Neurolink** is dropped.

<h2><a id="TwintaniaStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

The three **Neurolinks** need to be dropped in a triangle formation, at the same distance from the centre of the arena like this:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "neurolinks.jpg" }}">

**<u>Start of the fight (100% to 75%)</u>**

Pull *Twintania* at the first Neurolink location. She will immediately start with a **Plumet**.

Right after, she will cast **Twister** followed by **Fireball**. First place the **Twisters** out of your way, either by disengaging from the boss or moving in a straight line. Then, everyone minus the Tanks regroup behind the boss to share the **Fireball**.

Swap Tanks during the incoming **Death Sentence**.

**Plumet** will soon follow, with a **Twister** and **Fireball** right after.

At this point, if *Twintania* hasn't dropped her first **Neurolink**, she will enrage.


**<u>First Neurolink Dropped (75% to 45%)</u>**

Once the **Neurolink** is on the ground, move her to the next location. You can make a small stop in the middle on the arena for a few seconds before resuming since she will be casting.

*Twintania* will start with a **Liquid Hell**, remember that your baiter has to be the only player away from the boss.  
When the 4th **Liquid Hell** explosion happens, a random DPS will get the **Generate** marker and have to move inside the **Neurolink**.  
When the **Hatch** reach the **Neurolink**, another **Liquid Hell** is launched. **=>** If your official baiter just got the **Generate** marker, you have to use another player to bait the **Liquid Hell** because nobody will be away from the boss, so each attack will be aimed at a random player.

**Death Sentence**, swap during the cast.

Then, *Twintania* will cast **Twister** into **Generate**. Marked DPS have to put their **Twisters** outside the **Neurolinks**. So dodge the **Twister** then move inside the **Neurolink**

And followed by a **Plumet**.

If the **Neurolink** isn't dropped yet, she will repeat **Liquid Hell** => **Generate** => **Liquid Hell** one more time.

**<u>Second Neurolink Dropped (45% to 0%)</u>**

Once the second **Neurolink** is on the ground, move her to the final location.

Another **Liquid Hell** on the baiter followed by a double **Generate**. Either callout which **Neurolink** you're using or use a priority system.

Once the **Hatches** explode, one random DPS will get the **Fireball** marker and a random player (except the main Tank) will get targeted by **Liquid Hell** for all 5 hits.  
If you're a melee or you've got the **Fireball** marker, try to bait the **Liquid Hell** so you can end up stacking with the rest of the group.

Another **Twister** into double **Generate**, remember to bait **Twister** before moving into the **Neurolink**.

**Plumet** is use again.

Then, it repeats, **Liquid Hell** on the official baiter followed by a double **Generate**.  
A **Fireball** with a random **Liquid Hell**.
The last **Death Sentence** and the enrage, **Aetheric Profusion**, right after.

<h2><a id="Nael Deus DarnusQuotes">Quotes</a></h2>

Through the second and the fourth phases, *Nael* will use quotes to tell which abilities she will use next instead of casting or showing telegraphs.
In order to easily identify which mechanics are hidden behind each quote, just find the keywords. If you see **fire, scorch or blazing** on the first part of a quote, it means that **Thermonic Beam** is the first mechanic.
Most of the time, there's only two or four possible quotes used at a specific moment, reducing the randomness.

+ First set:
	+ _O hallowed **moon**, take **fire and scorch** my foes!_ : **Lunar Dynamo** => **Thermionic Beam**
	+ _O hallowed **moon**, shine you the **iron** path!_ : **Lunar Dynamo** => **Iron Chariot**

+ Second set:
	+ _**Blazing** path, lead me to **iron** rule!_ : **Thermionic Beam** => **Iron Chariot**
	+ _Take **fire**, O hallowed **moon**!_ : **Thermionic Beam** => **Lunar Dynamo**

+ Third set:
	+ _From on high I **descend**, the **iron** path to call!_ or _From on high I **descend**, the **iron** path to walk!_ : **Raven's Dive** => **Iron Chariot**
	+ _From on high I **descend**, the hallowed **moon** to call!_ : **Raven's Dive** => **Lunar Dynamo**

+ Fourth set:
	+ _Fleeting light! 'Neath the **red moon**, **scorch** you the earth!_ : **Dalamud Dive** => **Thermionic Beam**
	+ _Fleeting light! Amid a **rain of stars**, exalt you the **red moon**!_ : **Meteor Stream** => **Dalamud Dive**

+ Fifth set:
	+ _From on high I **descend**, the **moon** and **stars** to bring!_ : **Raven's Dive** => **Lunar Dynamo** => **Meteor Stream**
	+ _From hallowed **moon** I **descend**, a rain of **stars** to bring!_ : **Lunar Dynamo** => **Raven's Dive** => **Meteor Stream**

+ Sixth set:
	+ _From hallowed **moon** I **descend**, upon **burning** earth to tread!_ : **Lunar Dynamo** => **Raven's Dive** => **Thermionic Beam**
	+ _From hallowed **moon** I bare **iron**, in my **descent** to wield!_ : **Lunar Dynamo** => **Iron Chariot** => **Raven's Dive**
	+ _Unbending **iron**, take **fire** and **descend**!_ : **Iron Chariot** => **Thermionic Beam** => **Raven's Dive**
	+ _Unbending **iron**, **descend** with **fiery** edge!_ : **Iron Chariot** => **Raven's Dive** => **Thermionic Beam**

<h2><a id="Nael Deus DarnusStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

<em>Note about this phase: players will have to juggle with their <span class="speDebuff">Icebitten</span> and <span class="speDebuff">Firescorched</span> debuffs.  
There's multiple way to do it but this guide will cover the <strong>Fireball</strong> IN/OUT/IN/IN way. It is the easiest one since players won't have to care about their current debuffs since they will cancel each other on their own. Reducing RNG in this phase a bit more.</em>

Once *Twintania* disappear, everyone should regroup next the South **Neurolink** toward the centre of the arena.

**Heavensfall** will push back everyone near the wall, quickly heal the group and spread around the allagan monolith. Stand into the safe spot from **Thermionic Burst** slices, then move to an adjacent slice once the first set explode.  
At the same time, *Nael* will attack with **Meteor Stream**, remember to stay spread to not overlap them.

Finally, *Nael* will jump with **Dalamud Dive** on the player who was tanking Twintania when she died. Take care to not get caught in the AoE. She will immediately follow with **Bahamut's Claw**.  
The main Tank can use his invulnerability for both **Dalamud Dive** and **Bahamut's Claw** to reduce the strain of the Healers.

Next, *Nael* will summon the dragons and buff herself with **Bahamut's Favor**. In the meantime, move *Nael* away from the centre so the group can stack mid without being inside her hitbox.

Two players will get the <span class="speDebuff">Thunderstruck</span> debuff while *Nael* <ins>first quote</ins> is pronounced. It will be **Lunar Dynamo** followed by **Iron Chariot** (_O hallowed **moon**, shine you the **iron** path!_) or **Thermionic Beam** (_O hallowed **moon**, take **fire and scorch** my foes!_)  
The players with <span class="speDebuff">Thunderstruck</span> will move to *Nael* side rear while the rest of the group will stack in front of her.  
<span class="speDebuff">Thunderstruck</span> and the **Lunar Dynamo** will resolve at the same time, then either stack for **Thermonic Beam** or move out for **Iron Chariot**. Once it's is done, the whole group will stack together for **Fireball**.  

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="quote1-1.jpg;quote1-2.jpg;quote1-3.jpg" imgDesc="The group stack in front for <strong>Lunar Dynamo</strong> witrh the Thunderstruck player behind <em>Nael</em>;If <strong>Iron Chariot</strong>, move away from the boss (or stack for <strong>Thermionic Beam</strong>);Regroup in front of the boss for the <strong>Fireball</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Also, **Wing of Salvation** puddles will start to appear, one before **Fireball** and one after. If you have to avoid them, rotate around *Nael*.  
When the first **Wing of Salvation** puddle explode, the player with the 5s <span class="speDebuff">Doom</span> debuff grab the cleanse puddle, and the 10s <span class="speDebuff">Doom</span> debuff will do the same when the second cleanse puddle is available.

Have a break while *Nael* uses **Bahamut's Claw** on the main Tank.

Another player will get tethered for **Fireball**, that player will move alone behind *Nael* while the rest stack in front of her. When the **Fireball** is done, the players with the newly acquired Thunderstuck will move behind *Nael* so it can resolve in peace.

Quickly stack middle for the <ins>second quote</ins> since it will be **Thermionic Beam** followed by either **Iron Chariot** (_**Blazing** path, lead me to **iron** rule!_) or **Lunar Dynamo** (_Take **fire**, O hallowed **moon**!_). Think about using mitigation for **Thermionic Beam**.  
When the second part of the quote is performed, a new set of **Wing of Salvation** and <span class="speDebuff">Doom</span> debuff will happen. The player with 5s on his debuff takes the first cleanse puddle, the one with 10s takes the second and the one with 15s takes the last. To sum up, if you have 3-4 seconds left on your debuff, it's your turn to cleanse.  
When the last **Wing of Salvation** puddle appear, two <span class="speDebuff">Thunderstruck</span> will be applied. These players have to disengage from the boss to not cleave the group since everyone had to dodge the puddle.  
Once the debuffs are done, everyone regroups mid for the incoming **Fireball** except the player who got the previous one to avoid getting two <span class="speDebuff">Firescorched</span> stacks.

Another break with **Bahamut's Claw**.

Spread for the incoming <ins>third quote</ins> that will always start with **Raven's Dive** followed by **Iron Chariot** (_From **on high I descend**, the **iron** path to call!_ or _From **on high I descend**, the **iron** path to walk!_) or **Lunar Dynamo** (_From **on high I descend**, the hallowed **moon** to call!_).  
So move in or out accordingly, but everyone has to stack together for the last **Fireball**.  
Stay stacked for the **Fireball**, then dodge the **Wing of Salvation** puddles. Right after the **Fireball** explosion, players with <span class="speDebuff">Thunderstruck</span> have to move away. Once again, don't hesitate to disengage from the boss since everyone will be scattered around *Nael* and the **Wing of Salvation** puddles.  
Don't forget to purge the last <span class="speDebuff">Doom</span> debuffs.

*Nael* will now cast **Ravensbeak**, don't forget to swap Tanks.

**Divebombs** will now happen. When a dive marker appear on a player, that player must move to its appropriate position. 
While the first dive marker appears, *Nael* will tell her <ins>fourth quote</ins> where she will perform **Dalamud Dive** => **Thermionic Beam** (_Fleeting light! 'Neath the **red moon**, **scorch** you the earth!_) or **Meteor Stream** => **Dalamud Dive** (_Fleeting light! Amid a **rain of stars**, exalt you the **red moon**!_).  
If it is the former, leave the tank alone and once **Dalamud Dive** is done, regroup under *Nael*. If it is the latter, everyone spread from each other and once you've been hit, regroup under *Nael* and leave the tank alone for **Dalamud Dive**.  
But before performing her quote, she will throw 4 **Hypernova** to the furthest player, usually players with the dive marker. The first and third divebomb markers will disappear as soon as they get it by a Hypernova, so they can move out of the puddle immediately. The second divebomb marker will have to run to the left of their baiting spot, wait for **Hypernova** then move clockwise to get out of the puddle, the marker will disappear at the same time.

Right after *Nael* perform the second mechanic of her quote, she will use **Bahamut's Claw**.

Next, *Nael* will tell two quotes in succession from the first, second or third set. It's pure random.

Finally, *Nael* will force another tank swap with **Ravensbeak** followed by **Bahamut's Claw** before casting the enrage **Megaflare**.

<h2><a id="Bahamut PrimeStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

Once *Nael* is defeated, group all together at mid-distance between the edge and the centre for the incoming **Seventh Umbral Era**.  
As soon as the group get pushed, use the Tank LB. If LB3 is available, it will require few healing to survive the four **Calamitous Flames**. Otherwise, use LB2 and quickly heal between each hit.

*Bahamut Prime* will become targetable and use *Nael* enmity list, so swap Tank if you want to.

Quickly turn the boss away from the group before he casts **Flare Breath** followed by **Flatten**.

<a id="SQuickmarch Trio"></a>Then **Bahamut Prime** will call his friend for **Quickmarch Trio**. Once they leave the arena, quickly identify where they flew to. This location will be considered as North for this **Trio**.  
The whole gang will dive in a straight line, you have the group split in two groups, to the East and West, next to the edges. When the gang is diving (check the focus target/enmity list for the cast), take a few steps toward the centre to bait the **Twisters** on the edge.   
Stay spread and wait for the **Megaflare** puddles and AoEs to happen.  
*Bahamut Prime* will come back and everyone will get into position, relative to *Bahamut Prime*. The three DPS with a **Megaflare** marker will stack behind, the DPS with **Earthshaker** will be in front, the two Healers move to the left and right side with their **Earthshaker** and the Tanks will grab the **Tempest Wing** tether and position themselves between the boss and their Healer. If the tether is on the **Megaflare** stack, wait for the stack explosion before picking it up:

*Bahamut Prime* will continue with **Flare Breath** and a **Flatten**. You can use the cooldown(s) from **Tempest Wing** running for these tankbusters.

<a id="SBlackfire Trio"></a>The gang is back again for **Blackfire Trio**.  When it starts, the group has to face *Nael* and when the first **Liquid Hell** appears, start to move toward *Nael* (don't use sprint except if you're late compare to the rest of the group). Between the third and fourth **Liquid Hell**, *Nael* will use **Thermionic Beam** on the group but keep moving toward her. After **Thermionic Beam**, try to get everyone healed up quickly as the group will split in two, while facing *Nael*, Tanks and Healers to the left and DPS to the right.  
One Tank, one Healer and two DPS will get a **Megaflare** marker, they will stack behind the fire puddle, opposite of *Nael*. 4 **Megaflare** towers will spawn on each side but don't step inside yet. Wait for the first **Hypernova** to be fired to move in the tower. If the stack is targeted by a **Hypernova**, move away from *Nael* to stay stack.  
Don't forget to dodge the last **Hypernova** before regrouping mid for **Gigaflare**:

*Bahamut Prime* will use **Flare Breath** three time in a row.

<a id="SFellruin Trio"></a>Back with the gang and **Fellruin Trio**. The boss will appear above the **Neurolink**, move toward *Nael* that will tell her quote from the fifth set. Either spread, then move under her for **Raven's Dive** => **Lunar Dynamo** (_From on high I **descend**, the **moon** and **stars** to bring!_) or move under then spread for **Lunar Dynamo** => **Raven's Dive** (_From hallowed **moon** I **descend**, a rain of **stars** to bring!_).  
Once it's done, the group will move inside the **Neurolink** under *Nael*. Each Tanks will grab the **Tempest Wing** tethers and move inside *Bahamut Prime* and *Twintania*'s **Neurolinks**.  
When **Aetheric Profusion** and **Tempest Wings** are done, everyone has to spread for the last part of the quote, **Meteor Stream**.  
After being hit, move in front of *Bahamut Prime* to get healed and mitigate the incoming **Gigaflare**.

Tank's meal, *Bahamut Prime* will use **Flare Breath** then **Flatten** and another **Flare Breath** after.

<a id="SHeavensfall Trio"></a>Once again I'm asking you to welcome the gang with **Heavensfall Trio**. Regroup mid to bait the dive.  
If *Nael* isn't in the middle, once the markers appear, split into left and right group relative to *Bahamut Prime* and *Twintania* to avoid their dives. When *Twintania* dives, take a step in to bait the *Twister* along the edge. Then wait and spread a bit for **Megaflare**:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="heavensfall1.jpg;heavensfall2.jpg;heavensfall3.jpg;heavensfall4.jpg" imgDesc="Regroup mid;Split into two groups when the markers appear;Step in to bait the <strong>Twisters</strong>;Stay spread for the <strong>Megaflare</strong> towers and puddles;" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

If *Nael* appears between *Twintania* and *Bahamut Prime*, you have to split into four groups of 2. Bait the **Twisters** and **Megaflare** puddles the same way:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "heavensfall2b.jpg" }}">

Afterward, you'll use the **Heavensfall** knockback to get pushed into your tower. The players who dodged to the right will take the 4 towers to the right of *Nael*, the one under *Nael* included. Whereas the players who dodged to the left will take the towers to the left of *Nael*.  
After the knockback you have one second to adjust your position:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="heavensfall5.jpg;heavensfall6.jpg" imgDesc="Align yourself with your tower. Avoid the middle of the arena;Adjust your position after the knockback to stand inside" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The allagan monolith will use **Thermionic Bursts**. Two opposites slices will explode and rotate until a full circle has been made. Simultaneously, *Nael* will throw 3 *Hypernovas* Start to run from the edge of the arena, and run in a curve way to end up close to the monolith and avoid the **Hypernovas** at the same.  
Once **Thermionic Bursts** is over, *Twintania* will target a random person for **Fireball**. **Gigaflare** will end this **Trio**.  
Don't hesitate to sacrifice the **Fireball** player if the group is low to survive to **Gigaflare**.

Triple **Flare Breath** from *Bahamut Prime*, *wink* *wink*.

<a id="STenstrike Trio"></a>Guess who's back? THE GANG. With **Tenstrike Trio**. *Twintania* will appear middle and three random players will get a **Generate** marker. Also *Nael* will use **Meteor Stream** on every player, one by one on the DPS then the Healers then the Tanks, so stay spread until **Generate** is over.  
The three player with the marker will stand inside a **Neurolink** and soak their **Hatch**. Once it's done, a second set of **Hatches** will target the same players. These players have to move out toward the edge and three other players have to intercept the **Hatches** while inside a **Neurolink**. <u>The <strong>Hatch</strong> is badly coded, so if you have the marker, don't wriggle and move away in a straight line or the <strong>Hatch</strong> may go TokyoDrift™ for no reason.</u>

Then four players will get a **Earthshaker** marker. Shortly after, the other four players will also receive a **Earthshaker** marker.  
The first **Earthshakers** will spread to the South side of the arena and not far from the edge. The other will be safe North and will get their marker soon. While dodging the first set, these players can already preposition around a marker to show where they're going.  
Once the set is done, the players who got hit will move North while the newly marked player with spread South. Since *Bahamut Prime* appear after the first set, you can put the **Earthshaker** in melee range.  
**Gigaflare** is next to end this Trio.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="tenstrike1.jpg;tenstrike2.jpg" imgDesc="First <strong>Earthshakers</strong>;Second <strong>Earthshakers</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then *Bahamut Prime* will use **Flatten** and **Flare Breath**. At this point, *Bahamut Prime* needs to be under 60%, otherwise he will gain a <span class="buff">Damage Up</span> buff that will cause a wipe afterward.

<a id="SGrand Octet"></a>The gang is back one last time for **Grand Octet**.  
Once everyone is here, identify where *Bahamut Prime* is. If he's at a cardinal, the group will move counter-clockwise. Otherwise, if he's at an intercardinal, the group will rotate clockwise.  
Once the dive markers appear, move to the opposite side of *Bahamut Prime*. As soon as *Nael* dives, the group can start moving in the planned direction. Only use sprint if you're behind the group.  
When the *Bahamut Prime* marker appears, move back to the middle of the arena.  
While all of this happen, watch if you got a dive marker on you. Because the last dive will be on the player that didn't get any marker:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

If *Nael* is in front of *Bahamut Prime*, you have to move to an adjacent spot next to *Neal* since she is the first to dive.  
Once the dive markers appear, if you have to rotate clockwise (because *Bahamut Prime* is at an intercardinal), go to the first clockwise spot after *Nael*. If you have to rotate counter-clockwise, move to the first counter-clockwise spot after *Nael*:

When only *Twintania* is left, the player who didn't get a dive marker will have to bait *Twintania* last **Divebomb**. However, at the same time, 4 **Megaflare** towers will spawn in the centre of the arena and 1 Tank, 1 Healer and 2 DPS will get a **Megaflare** marker. It means that the **Divebomb** player can either, get to soak a tower or stack for **Megaflare** with the others.  
To solve that, the player with the dive marker stays left of *Twintania* while the **Megaflares** players stack to the right. The other three players will have to stand inside a tower but let the closest one available for the dive player. That way, if he has to soak a tower, he will be next to it.  
When *Twintania* dives, **Twisters** will appear. The stack can split in two-way to ensure that no overlap happen. And the towers players can run around inside their tower to bait **Twister**, that way, the stack players can move between towers to bait the **Twisters** without any problems. (Tower players can also bait the **Twister** outside of it although I don't recommend it).

*Nael* and *Twintania* must be killed at the same time. When one die, the other will start casting his enrage.

If the <u>Aethertrail Attunement</u> reaches 100 when it is casted, it's a wipe.  
If the gauge in inferior to 100, the whole group will be killed before being resurrected by *Phoenix*. *Phoenix* will bring everyone to full hp, grant a full LB3 to the group and a <span class="buff">Phoenix's Blessing</span> buff to every player, that doubles the damage done and lasts until the player death.  
This resurrection doesn't put a <span class="debuff">Weakness</span> debuff on players, but it will refresh the <span class="debuff">Weakness</span> duration if someone got it before getting hit by **Treaflare**.

*Nael* and *Twintania* will spawn to the North of the arena. If you're annoyed with *Bahamut Prime* being shinnier than your phone screen while you're in your bed, you can move the bosses. As long as they are tanked between two **Neurolinks**.  
Since they both use *Bahamut Prime* enmity table, the second Tank has to provoke one of them when the phase starts.

They will both start with a **Bahamut's Claw** and **Plumet**.

Then, *Twintania* will cast **Liquil Hell** that must be baited as usual.  
Right when it ends, a triple **Generate** will target 3 random DPS. To easily resolve this, assign a **Neurolink** to 3 DPS. The last DPS will be floating and will pick the empty **Neurolink** if he has a marker.  
But at the same time, *Twintania* will also cast **Twister**. If you're standing in a **Neurolink** next to the bosses. You can soak the **Hatch** then move away from the **Twister**. However, if you're in the far away **Neurolink**, you have to bait the **Twister** before moving in.

*Nael* will now tell a quote from the sixth set with four possibilities, two of them start with **Lunar Dynamo** and two other with **Iron Chariot**.  
When the three mechanics from the quote are over, **Twister** is cast.

Mitigate the incoming **Megaflare** from *Nael*.  
Then **Ravensbeak** and **Death Sentence** tankbusters will require a Tank swap. Followed by their classic tankbusters: **Bahamut's Claw** and **Plumet**.

From now on, it will be a repeat. *Twintania* will use **Liquid Hell** followed by a triple **Generate** and **Twister**.

*Nael* will perform another quote from the sixth set. But if the previous quote started with **Lunar Dynamo** this one will start with **Iron Chariot**, reducing the possibilities to two quotes.  
Don't forget the **Twister** at the end of the quote.

Another Tank swap will be enforced with **Ravensbeak** and **Death Sentence**. With a **Megaflare** coming next.

You can now use your caster LB to finish them both at the same.

<h2><a id="Golden BahamutStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

The DPS check is this phase is pretty lennient as long as you mitigate and dodge every ability properly. Hence don't worry about your uptime but about staying live. Ah, ah ah!

To start with, *Golden Bahamut* will use **Morh Afah**. Every **Morn Afah** require mitigation and planned beforehand.
Next is the first **Akh Morn**, hitting three times. Have the Tanks stack together and use all their defensive cooldowns, they will be back for the last one.

**Exaflare** is next. It can cross the arena in any of the eight direction and each set of AoE won't always be adjacent, rendering this mechanic a bit random.  
You can move to the wall, stand where the third explosion is and move inside the first one when it's done.  
You can also move between the first and second explosion.  
And you can cross through one AoE. Just stand at the edge of it and when it explodes, quickly move in. The timing needs to be on point however. Only use this technique when you know what you're doing.

Once it's done, second **Akh Morn**, hitting four times. Use one of your tank invunerability.  
Followed by **Morn Afah**, once again mitigate it.  
And another set of **Exaflare**.

Next is **Morn Afah**, mitigate it, with the third **Akh Morn** after, that will hit five times. Use your second Tank invulnerability for this one.  
**Exaflare** once again.

Fourth **Morn Afah**, then the fourth **Akh Morn**, hitting six times. Have the Tanks use all their defensive cooldowns again.  
**Exaflare**, and another one.

Final **Morn Afah** that need to be mitigated.

And now the very last **Morn Afah**, the soft enrage. Everyone should be spread to avoid clipping other player, and give you more time to kill *Golden Bahamut*.
