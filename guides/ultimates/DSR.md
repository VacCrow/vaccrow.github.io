<h2><a id="TheVaultKnightsStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

Pull both bosses and bring them middle. Focus *Ser Adelphel* during the opener since he will disappear multiple times during the phase.  
*Ser Adelphel* will use **Holiest of Holy**.

Next, *Ser Grinnaux* will start casting **Empty Dimension** and *Ser Adelphel* will tether to a random player.  
The group will move South, on *Ser Grinnaux* hitbox, to mitigate and stack together for the incomming **Heavensblaze**. Meanwhile, one Tank will grab the tether, move North of *Ser Grinnaux* and use his invulnerability to cover for **Holy Shield Bash** and **Holy Blade Dance**.  
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "holyBash.jpg" }}">

*Ser Adelphel* will leave the arena and *Ser Grinnaux* will jump to the middle to cast **Hyperdimensional Slash**.  
The marked players will fan out North and aim as shown in the diagram while the 4 others stack South the boss. Once the first set of attacks is done, roles will be reversed, with marked players fanning out South and the rest stacking North:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="hyperdim1.jpg;hyperdim2.jpg" imgDesc="Marked players fan out North, the rest stack South;Marked players fan out South, the rest stack North" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Ser Adelphel* will appear on a cardinal and *Ser Grinnaux* will cast **Faith Unmoving**. Move away from *Ser Adelphel* or use the knockback from **Faith Unmoving** to do so and wait for *Ser Adelphel*.  
After the first dash, move toward the cardinal where *Ser Adelphel* dashed to and stop mid-way to dodge the *Brightspheres* explosions.  
The Tank with *Ser Adelphel* 's aggro will resume his course after the explosion to take **Execution** alone:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="shinning1.jpg;shinning2.jpg;shinning3.jpg;shinning4.jpg" imgDesc="Watch where <em>Ser Adelphel</em> is and get knocked to the opposite side;Watch where he dashes and move in that direction;Stop mid-way to dodge <em>Brightspheres</em> explosions;<em>Ser Adelphel</em>'s Tank resume his run for <strong>Execution</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Bring back the bosses middle. The Tank in charge of *Ser Adelphel* must interrupt **Holiest Hallowing** cast in the mean time.

Soon after, *Ser Grinnaux* will cast **Faith Unmoving** and chain markers will be applied to everyone:  
+ The Tanks move North of *Ser Grinnaux* and the Healers South before the chains are assigned.
+ The Tank and Healer with the <span style="color: dodgerblue">Cross</span> won't move while the Tank with the <span style="color: Orchid">Square</span> will move to the next clockwise spot and the Healer with the <span style="color: MediumSeaGreen">Triangle</span> will move to the next counter-clockwise spot.
+ The DPS with the <span style="color: MediumSeaGreen">Triangle</span> and <span style="color: Orchid">Square</span> will move to the opposite side of their partner and the two <span style="color: Tomato">Circle</span> take the remaining East and West spots.  
Stand inside *Ser Grinnaux* hitbox to get knocked away and easily break the chains then wait a bit for **Heavensflame** to resolve on everyone before regrouping.

The physical ranged DPS (or the Tank in charge of *Ser Grinnaux*) must interrupt **Holiest Hallowing** cast that happend right after **Heavensflame**.

Bring back the bosses together. Mitigate the incomming **Holiest of Holy** and move in or out for **Empty/Full Dimension**.  
Immediatly after, the Tank in charge of *Ser Adelphel* must interrupt the **Holiest Hallowing** cast.  
Afterward, *Sir Adelphel* will cast another **Holiest of Holy**.

Finally they will cast their enrages **Brightblade's Steel** and **The Bull's Steel**.

___

<a id="SPlanarImprisonment">If they are killed in time, *Ser Grinnaux* will pull everyone into a smaller arena. Right after, *Ser Charibert* will start to cast **Pure of Heart** and need to be brought as low as possible.

The group will stay middle at max melee range. Then the first pair will move inside *Ser Charibert*  's hitbox between him and the wall to bait the first set of **Brightwing** toward the outside. Once they're hit, they move to a side of the arena at max melee range and wait there to lose their <span class="speDebuff">Skyblind</span> debuff before going back with the group.  
The pairs order is the following: <u>Tanks -> Ranged DPS -> Melee DPS -> Healers</u>. The Melees will move to the left side to drop their debuff while the Ranged will move to the right side:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="planar1.jpg;planar2.jpg;planar3.jpg;planar4.jpg;planar5.jpg;planar6.jpg" imgDesc="Tanks move in;Tanks to the left side and Ranged DPS move in;Ranged DPS to the right side and Melee DPS move in;Melee DPS to the left side and Healers move in;Healers can wait here;Healers mid and heal everyone" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

If one person survive, you'll reach the next phase that has a checkpoint.  
*Note: if Ser Charibert won't be low enough, you can cheese the mechanic by boosting a Tank mitigation so he may survive the damage or timing a ressurection right when Pure of Heart is happening.*

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<h2><a id="ThordanStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

You can restart the fight to reset your cooldowns.

Pull *Thordan* and have the group stacked behind the boss to bait the incoming **Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**. When the cast bar is over, dodge to his sides.  
Right after, *Thordan* will perform **Ascalon’s Might** three times in a row, use your Tank invulnerability to go through.  
Next *Thordan* will summon his Knights and cast **Strength of the Ward**. You can swap Tanks during the cast for later.

<a id="SStrengthOfTheWard">As soon as *Thordan* leaves, everyone has to spread around the arena and wait for the Dragoon Knights to arrive. If a player has a Dragoon Knight behind him, that player will move toward the middle of the arena telling that his position is unsafe. The player on the opposite side will also move to the middle since it's not safe. The players who moved will regroup at the safe spots with their respective light party in order to dodge **Spiral Thrusts**.  
Then each light party will form a triangle within their safe spot to avoid overlaping **Lightning Storm**. The Healer shall be on the corner near the middle, the DPS on corners along the edge and the Tank along the edge between the DPS:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="strength1.jpg;strength2.jpg;strength3.jpg" imgDesc="Spread out;Find the safe spots;Regroup with your party" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Once both attacks are done, each party regroups and dodge together the **Heavy Impact** AoEs. Watch the enemy list for **Ascalon’s Might** cast bar and move out to dodge them. Then, get some healing before the next mechanics.

Then two Paladin Knights will appear along with **Dimensional Collapse** AoEs and **Conviction** towers. *Thordan* will also move to the cardinal/incardinal opposite of the Paladin Knights (where they're facing at).  
Three non-Tank players will receive a **Skyward Leap** marker and each of them has to move to a safe spot away from *Thordan*, next to the edge. <u>The players next to <em>Thordan</em> has to move away from him by a few step.</u>  
The non-Tank players that aren't marked will move right underneath *Thordan* to receive **The Dragon’s Rage**. The two Tanks has to quickly grab the **Holy Shield Bash** tethers and run toward *Thordan* safe spot. The Tanks will take the far left/right corner of the safe spot while crossing the tethers to reduce the damage taken and create a bigger safe zone for the non-marked players.  
Once **Skyward Leap** and **The Dragon’s Rage** are done. The previously marked players will move into the tower in front of them while the players who stacked will split among the 3 closest towers.
Example with *Thordan* North:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="strength4.jpg;strength5.jpg;strength6.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Skyward Leap</strong> players spread away from <em>Thordan</em>, unmarked players under him and Tanks to their sides with tethers crossed;Everything resolves;Everyone moves into the closest tower" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When *Thordan* jumps back mid, regroup and heal everyone for the incoming **Ancient Quaga**.  
Followed by **Heavenly Heel** into three **Ascalon’s Might**, use the Tank invulnerability.  
Next *Thordan* will once again summon his Knights and cast **Sanctity of the Ward**.

<a id="SSanctityOfTheWard">Two Paladin Knights will appear mid, facing opposite direction and a Dark Knight (*Ser Zephirin*) will appear along the edge. Quickly identify *Ser Janlenoux* (Silver armour with a white plume), if he's on the West side, everyone will rotate counter-clockwise to dodge, if he's East then it's clockwise. (You can also check the closest Paladin after you're groupped, you'll move toward the intercardinal that this Paladin isn't facing to)  
When *Thordan* leaves, quickly form two groups of 4 East and West. Then two **Sacred Sever** markers will appear and groups need to be reajusted:
+ Marked player: they change group in order that #1 is away from *Ser Zephirin* while #2 is near him.
+ Non-marked Tanks: if there's no marker in your group, swap group. Otherwise stay.
+ Non-marked player: do nothing ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

With the group reformed, take position to the East and West next to the edge and turn away from *Thordan* and the *Dragon Eye*. If one of them is East or West, you can take a few step clockwise/counter-clockwise to have an easier time to dodge.  
When everything is happening, both groups must run clockwise or counter-clockwise based on *Ser Janlenoux* 's position but stop before they reach the next intercardinal spot in order to end up in the small safe spot available.  
Once the *Brightspheres* from the second dash explode, go back to your East and West spot to avoid the last dashes.

Here's an example with *Ser Janlenoux* being West, so dodging counter-clockwise:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="sanctity1.jpg;sanctity2.jpg;sanctity3.jpg;sanctity4.jpg;sanctity5.jpg;sanctity6.jpg" imgDesc="Split into light group and look out for <em>Thordan</em>, the <em>Dragon Eye</em> and <em>Ser Janlenoux</em>;Reform group with marker 1 away from <em>Ser Zephirin</em> and marker 2 close to him;Move to the East and West and look away from <em>Thordan</em> and the <em>Dragon Eye</em>;Move to the next counter-clockwise intercardinal but stop a few notch away from it during the second dash;You're safe from the second set of <em>Brightspheres</em> explosion;Move back to the East and West" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Everyone regroups mid for heal then pre-spread in pairs at each cardinal with a Tank/Healer and a DPS. Each pair will be in charge of a quadrant as shown bellow:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "sanctityMeteor.jpg" }}">

Two players will get the meteor marker. These players need to be on pair opposite of each other: North and South by default, the only exception is if they're already opposite of each other East and West. If a player need to swap his position, he has to swap with a player of the same role, a Tank/Healer with another Tank/Healer for example.  
Once the groups are set, each pair has to stand between the **Heavens' Stake** AoEs to place **Heimal Storm** without overlapping inner and outter towers.  
After **Heimal Storm** happens, it's time to soak **Conviction** towers within your quadrant:
+ If there's one inner and one outter tower, the meteor player role moves out and the other moves in.
+ If there's two outter towers, the Tank/Healer takes the most clockwise one while the DPS takes the most counter-clockwise one.
+ Inner players adjust with the available towers *rollSafe*.

Once the first set of towers are soaked, the meteor players start to run clockwise around the arena without sprinting to reach the tower on the opposite side, North and South.  
<u>Players with the same role as the meteor players will soak the cardinals towers while the others will soak the intercardinal towers.</u>  
After a few second **Faith Unmoving** will happen, meteor and outter players must use their knockback immunity while the inner players use the knockback to get into their towers:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="sanctity7.jpg;sanctity8.jpg;sanctity9.jpg;sanctity10.jpg;sanctity11.jpg" imgDesc="Preform pairs on cardinals;Adjust pairs to have meteor players on North and South then move away to place the <em>Heimal Storm</em>;Move into your assigned tower;Meteor players start to run around clockwise, outter players get into their towers, inner players aligned themself to their towers;Either use the knockback to get into your towers or use your immunity" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

From this point, you may hold your 2 minutes cooldown for the reopener on the next phase if needed.  
*Thordan* will teleport North and cast **Ultimate End**. Heal and use proper mitigation for this raid-wide.  
Then *Thordan* will move a bit toward mid and use **Broad Swing**. Stand behind him and move into the first cleave once it happend. He will turn and repeat this a second time.

The enrage, **Aetheric Burst**, is then casted to end this phase.

<h2><a id="NidhoggEyesAbilities">Abilities Breakdown</a></h2>

After *Estinien* retakes control of his body, *Alphinaud* will appear along with *Haurchefant* and *Ysayle* spirits. Haurchefant will tether to a random player and Ysayle will tether to Alphinaud. After 5 seconds the tethered players will drop a AoE on the ground that gives a buff lasting 90 seconds to anyone inside:
+ <span class="speDebuff">Soul of Friendship</span>: given by *Haurchefant*: allows to deal damage to the *Right Eye*.
+ <span class="speDebuff">Soul of Devotion</span>: given by *Ysayle*: allows to deal damage to the *Left Eye*.

Once the *Left Eye* and *Right Eye* appear, the Duty Gauge will start to fill. When it reaches 100, *Nidhogg* will take control of *Estinien* and wipe the groupe. The Duty Gauge dissapears when both *Eyes* are dead.

The *Right Eye* appears with only 50% of its health.

___

+ **<ins>Resentment</ins>:**

	+ <span class="speDebuff">Clawbound</span>: these players will be chained to the *Left Eye*, in red. Any damage taken will also damage the *Left Eye*.
	+ <span class="speDebuff">Fangbound</span>: these players will be chained to the *Right Eye*, in blue. Any damage taken will heal the *Right Eye*.

These debuffs can be swaped if two players with different debuffs touch each other. After swapping, both players will receive a <span class="speDebuff">Bound and Determined</span> debuff for 3 seconds, preventing them to swap again.

Each orb deals sharable <span class="magic">magical damage</span> and applying a <span class="debuff">Fire Resistance Down II</span> debuff for 12 seconds. The damage will scale with the orb size.

	**Flare Nova**:
	2 medium sized yellow orbs that spawn East and West. Since they're already big, they need to popped by 2 players each.

<h2><a id="NidhoggStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

For **Dive from Grace**, players will receive a set of debuffs and for the whole mechanic, they will use the following positions:
+ <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> and <span class="speDebuff">Third in Line</span>: they take position on West, South and East of *Nidhogg* hitbox. ***With <span class="speDebuff">Elusive Jump Target</span> on East facing away from the boss and <span class="speDebuff">Spineshatter Dive Target</span> on West looking at the boss.***
+ <span class="speDebuff">Second in Line</span>: they take position on North East and North West, slightly outside of *Nidhogg* hitbox.

<span class="speDebuff">Elusive Jump Target</span> and <span class="speDebuff">Spineshatter Dive Target</span> must aim their tower at the opposite side. In this example, the sumonner will toward the East to put his tower at *Nidhogg* West side:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "inLine.jpg" }}">

Furthemore, due to <span class="debuff">Fire Resistance Down II</span> timers, the **Darkdragon Dive** towers must be soaked by specific player based of your debuff:
+ 1st towers: by <span class="speDebuff">Third in Line</span> players.
+ 2nd towers: by <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> East and West players.
+ 3rd towers: by <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> South player and <span class="speDebuff">Second in Line</span> players.

___

<a id="SNidhogg">Once *Thordan* is dealt with, heal everyone and use mitigation for when *Nidhogg* dives into the arena with **Final Chorus**.

When *Nidhogg* is casting **Dive from Grace** the players will receive their numbers. <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> will pre-spread on East, South and West while <span class="speDebuff">Second in Line</span> will show their position on North East and North West.  
Then, once the cast is over and Dive debuff are set:
+ <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> players can readjust to follow the rule of "<span class="speDebuff">Elusive Jump Target</span> on East and <span class="speDebuff">Spineshatter Dive Target</span> on West".
+ <span class="speDebuff">Third in Line</span> players can call a cardinal if they all have <span class="speDebuff">High Jump Target</span>, otherwise use the rule of "<span class="speDebuff">Elusive Jump Target</span> on East and <span class="speDebuff">Spineshatter Dive Target</span> on West".

Have <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> players ready for the dives,  and the rest of the group stacked in front *Nidhogg* for **Eye of the Tyrant** during **Gnash and Lash/Lash and Gnash** cast, remember the in/out or out/in sequence.  
Once the share and dives happend, quickly move in or out for **Gnash** or **Lash**.  
In the meantime the <span class="speDebuff">Third in Line</span> player have to get in position to soak the tower, remember to run around the boss hitbox if you must dodge **Gnashing Wheel** to reach South. Move out or in for **Lash** or **Gnash** when soaking the towers. Then move out to bait **Geirskogul**.

Example with **Lash and Gnash**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dfg1.jpg;dfg2.jpg;dfg3.jpg" imgDesc="First in Line dives on East, South and West. The rest stacks North;Dodge <strong>Lashing Wheel</strong>;Dodge <strong>Gnashing Wheel</strong> and Third in Line soak towers;Move slightly out to bait <strong>Geirskogul</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Right after the second **Lash** or **Gnash** happend, the <span class="speDebuff">Second in Line</span> players must move to their position to get dived at. Right after, the East and West <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> players will move in to soak the towers and bait the incoming **Geirskogul**.
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dfg4.jpg;dfg5.jpg;dfg6.jpg" imgDesc="Move slightly out to bait <strong>Geirskogul</strong> and Second in Line dives on North East and North West;East and West First in Line soak the towers;Bait <strong>Geirskogul</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

As soon as the first **Geirskogul** are done, the <span class="speDebuff">Third in Line</span> players must get into position for their dive and the rest of the party stack North for **Eye of the Tyrant**. Quickly get a look at the **Gnash and Lash/Lash and Gnash** cast and as soon as the **Dark Jumps** and **Eye of the Tyrant** happend, move out or in for **Lash** or **Gnash**.  
Then the <span class="speDebuff">First in Line</span> South player and <span class="speDebuff">Second in Line</span> players must get into the towers and dodge out or in for the second **Lash** or **Gnash**. Once it's done, move out and bait the **Geirskogul** as usual.

Example with **Gnash and Lash**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dfg7.jpg;dfg8.jpg;dfg9.jpg;dfg10.jpg" imgDesc="Third in Line at dives positions and the rest stacks North;Dodge <strong>Gnashing Wheel</strong>;Dodge <strong>Lashing Wheel</strong> and South First in Line and the Second in Line players soak the towers;Bait <strong>Geirskogul</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Nidhogg* will resume his auto-attacks so clear away from the main Tank. He will then cast **Drachenlance** on a random target, dodge it sideways.

Next is the final **Darkdragon Dive** towers, regroups in pairs at each intercardinal. If a tower only need one player, the Tank/Healer will adjust to satisfy another tower condition. The DPS will then bait the three **Geirskogul** toward the outside while the Tanks will grab the two **Soul Tether**. Have one Tank in front of *Nidhogg* and the second under him while the group stay away from them.

*Nidhogg* will cast a final **Drachenlance** before his enrage, **Revenge of the Horde**.

___

<a id="SLeft&RightEyes">Stack up on *Alphinaud* to receive <span class="speDebuff">Soul of Devotion</span> and <span class="speDebuff">Soul of Friendship</span>.

Each Tank must grab the *Eyes* enmity since they will auto-attack though this part. <u>Since the *Left Eye* will lose most of its health from damages taken by the players, everyone has to focus as much as possible the *Right Eye*.</u>  
And get some mitigation ready for the incoming **Resentment**.

Next, **Hatebound** will assign a debuff to everyone, be spread before the cast is over to avoid unnecessary swap:
+ Tanks and Melee DPS must get the blue chains, <span class="speDebuff">Fangbound</span>.
+ Healers and Ranged DPS must get the red chains, <span class="speDebuff">Clawbound</span>.

Any player with the wrong debuff has to stack mid, under *Estinien*. Thus they will automatically swap their debuffs to the correct one.

Then, Tanks and Healers will move toward the *Left Eye* while the DPS will move toward the *Right Eye*.  
Once the orbs are here, Healers and Ranged DPS have to wait for the yellow orbs to grow twice before soaking them in pairs. Then the Tanks and Healers will swap their debuffs and Melee and Ranged DPS will do the same. Finally, the Tanks and Melee DPS will wait for the second growth to happen, before taking the blue orbs.

Group up around the *Right Eye* without touching each other. The Healers and Ranged DPS will first move inside the *Right Eye* while the Tanks and Melee DPS will spread around it afterward.  
Every time a set of **Mirage Dive** is done, the next pairs will swap their debuff and position with the two players hit. The order is the following one:
	Healers -> Ranged DPS -> Flex (the two players who got hit first, they should have 3s left on their <span class="debuff">Piercing Resistance Down</span> debuff).

If the *Right Eye* isn't dead yet, quickly kill him before the next raidwide, **Steep in Rage**, or it will heal up. Then finish off the *Left Eye*, be aware of **Steep in Rage** damage.

There's only a few seconds left before the Duty Gauge is filled up.
