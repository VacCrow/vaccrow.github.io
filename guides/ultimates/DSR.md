<h2><a id="The Vault KnightsStrategy">Strategy</a></h2>

Pull both bosses and bring them middle. Focus *Ser Adelphel* during the opener since he will disappear multiple times during the phase.  
*Ser Adelphel* will use **Holiest of Holy**.

Next, *Ser Grinnaux* will start casting **Empty Dimension** and *Ser Adelphel* will tether to a random player.  
The group will move South, on *Ser Grinnaux* hitbox, to mitigate and stack together for the incomming **Heavensblaze**. Meanwhile, one Tank will grab the tether, move North of *Ser Grinnaux* and use his invulnerability to cover for **Holy Shield Bash** and **Holy Blade Dance**.  
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "holyBash.jpg" }}">

*Ser Adelphel* will leave the arena and *Ser Grinnaux* will jump to the middle to cast **Hyperdimensional Slash**.  
The marked players will fan out North and aim as shown in the diagram while the 4 others stack South the boss. Once the first set of attacks is done, roles will be reversed, with marked players fanning out South and the rest stacking North:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="hyperdim1.jpg;hyperdim2.jpg" imgDesc="Marked players fan out North, the rest stack South;Marked players fan out South, the rest stack North" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Ser Adelphel* will appear on a cardinal and *Ser Grinnaux* will cast **Faith Unmoving**. Move away from *Ser Adelphel* or use the knockback from **Faith Unmoving** to do so and wait for *Ser Adelphel*.  
After the first dash, move toward the cardinal where *Ser Adelphel* dashed to and stop mid-way to dodge the *Brightspheres* explosions.  
The Tank with *Ser Adelphel* 's aggro will resume his course after the explosion to take **Execution** alone:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="shinning1.jpg;shinning2.jpg;shinning3.jpg;shinning4.jpg" imgDesc="Watch where <em>Ser Adelphel</em> is and get knocked to the opposite side;Watch where he dashes and move in that direction;Stop mid-way to dodge <em>Brightspheres</em> explosions;<em>Ser Adelphel</em>'s Tank resume his run for <strong>Execution</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Bring back the bosses middle. The Tank in charge of *Ser Adelphel* must interrupt **Holiest Hallowing** cast in the mean time.

Soon after, *Ser Grinnaux* will cast **Faith Unmoving** and chain markers will be applied to everyone:  
+ The Tanks will move North of *Ser Grinnaux* and the Healers South.
+ The Tank and Healer with the <span style="color: dodgerblue">Cross</span> won't move while the Tank with the <span style="color: Orchid">Square</span> will move to the next clockwise spot and the Healer with the <span style="color: MediumSeaGreen">Triangle</span> will move to the next counter-clockwise spot.
+ The DPS with the <span style="color: MediumSeaGreen">Triangle</span> and <span style="color: Orchid">Square</span> will move to the opposite side of their partner and the two <span style="color: Tomato">Circle</span> take the remaining East and West spots.  
Stand inside *Ser Grinnaux* hitbox to get knocked away and easily break the chains then wait a bit for **Heavensflame** to resolve on everyone before regrouping.
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="chain1.jpg;chain2.jpg;chain3.jpg;chain4.jpg;chain5.jpg" imgDesc="Tanks North and Healers South;Tank/Healer Cross stay, Tank Square move one spot clockwise, Healer Triangle move one spot counter-clockwise;DPS fill the gap and Circles adjust;Stand inside <em>Ser Grinnaux</em> hitbox and get knocked back;Wait for <strong>Heavensflame</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The physical ranged DPS (or the Tank in charge of *Ser Grinnaux*) must interrupt **Holiest Hallowing** cast that happend right after **Heavensflame**.

Bring back the bosses together. Mitigate the incomming **Holiest of Holy** and move in or out for **Empty/Full Dimension**.  
Immediatly after, the Tank in charge of *Ser Adelphel* must interrupt the **Holiest Hallowing** cast.  
Afterward, *Sir Adelphel* will cast another **Holiest of Holy**.

Finally they will cast their enrages **Brightblade's Steel** and **The Bull's Steel**.

___

<a id="SPlanar Imprisonment">If they are killed in time, *Ser Grinnaux* will pull everyone into a smaller arena. Right after, *Ser Charibert* will start to cast **Pure of Heart** and need to be brought as low as possible.

The group will stay middle at max melee range. Then the first pair will move inside *Ser Charibert*  's hitbox between him and the wall to bait the first set of **Brightwing** toward the outside. Once they're hit, they move to a side of the arena at max melee range and wait there to lose their <span class="speDebuff">Skyblind</span> debuff before going back with the group.  
The pairs order is the following: <u>Tanks -> Ranged DPS -> Melee DPS -> Healers</u>. The Melees will move to the left side to drop their debuff while the Ranged will move to the right side:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="planar1.jpg;planar2.jpg;planar3.jpg;planar4.jpg;planar5.jpg;planar6.jpg" imgDesc="Tanks move in;Tanks to the left side and Ranged DPS move in;Ranged DPS to the right side and Melee DPS move in;Melee DPS to the left side and Healers move in;Healers can wait here;Healers mid and heal everyone" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Note: if Ser Charibert won't be low enough, you can cheese the mechanic by boosting a Tank mitigation so he may survive the damage or timing a ressurection right when Pure of Heart is happening.*
