<h1><a id='Strategy'>Strategy</a></h1>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>

*Eden's Promise* opens the fight with **Maleficium**.

The boss will then dash mid and do either **Junction Shiva** or **Junction Titan**.

Soon followed by **Rapturous Reach**. Dodge to the left or right then spread or stack in groups for **Junction Shiva/Titan**.

*Eden's Promise* will then perform **Cast**. The diagram below resumes every possibilities:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'primalsMemories.jpg' }}'>

Once **Cast** is done, swiftly spread or stack in groups for the second attack of **Junction Shiva/Titan**.

The Tanks have to be first and second in the enmity list for the incomming **Formless judgement**. Swap tanks during the cast.
The main target will use its invulnerability while the second target will use his defensive colldown to survive, assisted by the healers.

**Maleficium** says hi again.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SJunctionShiva'></a>

*Eden's Promise* will cast **Junction Shiva**.
Everyone regroups in the middle and prepares mitigation for the incoming **Diamond Dust**. There's no need to over mitigate this because there's 5 seconds after **Diamond Dust** for everyone to get healed.

When the **Icicle Impact** AoEs appear, slide to your group safe spot to share Ice Floe.

Once the stack is done, everyone has to slide to its position (roughly) to avoid clipping anyone with **Ice Pillar**. While facing the boss:

+ The healer will slide once to their left.
+ The ranged will slide once to their right.
+ The melee will slice once to their 10 o'clock, so he's in melee range.
+ The tank will can use his dash-in to get out of the AoE. If the dash isn't up, the tank can slide to his 2 o'clock but there's a risk of sliding into the other group's melee so adjust.

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="junctionS1.jpg;junctionS2.jpg;junctionS3.jpg;junctionS4.jpg" imgDesc="Stack in your group's safe spot;Wait for the first <strong>Icicles</strong> to explode;Slide to your assigned position;Watch the pillars get dropped" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When the pillars are dropped, quickly regroup mid to get some healing and raid mitigation. Then move to the safe spot opposite of your pillar to avoid the new set of Icicle Impact.

After the first part of **Icicle Impact** happens, immediately use your knockback immunity for avoid **Plunging Ice** knockback and move mid-ish to receive some quick heals before moving away from the pillar you're tethered with. Your tether has to become purple. There's a 3 second delay between **Plunging Ice** and **Pillar Pierce** to position yourself.
If you're unsure about being clipped by another pillar, move further back to the edge.

Another **Maleficium** is used then *Eden's Promise* will cast **Junction Titan**.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SJunctionTitan'></a>

**Earthen Fury** will be casted.

Once **Earthen Fury** is over, the first set of **Bomb Boulders** will drop.  
<ins>You can avoid the damage from the boulders when they drop if you're far enough from them aka stand between the two red circles:</ins>
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'avoidBoulderDamage.jpg' }}'>

The first set of boulders will be resolved by moving to the following positions:

+ <span style='color: darkorange'>Force</span>: Tank and Healer regroup to the West while DPS regroup to the East.
+ <span style='color: gold'>Pulse</span>: Tank moves South West, Healer moves South and DPS moves South East.
+ <span style='color: dodgerblue'>Weight</span>: DPS moves to the North.

The second set of boulders will be resolved by moving to the following positions:

+ <span style='color: darkorange'>Force</span>: Tank(s) and Healer(s) regroup to the West while DPS regroup to the East.
+ <span style='color: dodgerblue'>Weight</span>: Due to the randomness, find an available spot either North or South.

The third set of boulders will be resolved by moving to the following positions:

+ <span style='color: darkorange'>Force</span>: Everyone moves to the South.the North East.
+ <span style='color: gold'>Pulse</span>: Tank/Healer moves to the South West and DPS moves to the South East.
+ <span style='color: dodgerblue'>Weight</span>: Tank/Healer moves to the North West and DPS moves to the North East.

*Eden's Promise* will continue with **Maleficium**.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SGuardianOfEden'></a>

Now the boss will use **Cast** and at the same time *Guardian of Eden* will also perform **Obliteration**. Both will resolve at the same moment.
The group will always stack on the South, South East or East depending on the memories used. The main tank doesn't have to stack with the rest of the group if he's aligned with *Guardian of Eden* and the rest of the group.

*Eden's Promise* will cast another **Maleficium**.

Then *Eden's Promise* will use **Stock** so memorize which primals he's using. Once the cast is done, the main tank will move the boss toward the South.

Right after, the two Healers will be targeted by **Classical Sculpture**. Stack middle and South, with your respecting groups.  
Once the *Chiseled Sculptures* appear, everyone will get tether to them. You can spread to easily identify the sculpture you're tethered with.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="chiseled1.jpg;chiseled2.jpg" imgDesc="Stack with your group;Spread to indentify your assigned number and Sculpture" slideNumber=3 %}

Start to move toward your assigned *Sculpture*. <ins>BUT the main tank has to keep *Eden's Promise* facing the same direction until he casts **Rapturous Reach**.</ins>  
When **Rapturous Reach** is casting and the safe spot is known, the numbers "One" can position themselves to bait **Blade Of Flame** away.  
The first **Blades Of Flame** and **Rapturous Reach** will happen at the same time.  
Then the "2" players will replace the "1" players. If you're located on the South of the arena, remember to bait the laser toward the South.  
After the second laser, *Guardian of Eden* will start to cast **Palm Of Temperance**. Start to move next to the hand and keep baiting the laser.  
Last numbers, the player baiting far from the hand may have to use sprint to get there in time. The knockback will happen 2 seconds after the fourth laser:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="chiseled3.jpg;chiseled4.jpg;chiseled5.jpg;chiseled6.jpg" imgDesc="Players with '1' bait;Players with '2' bait;Players with '3' bait and the rest can already move toward the hand;Players with '4' bait" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When **Palm Of Temperance** happens, *Eden's Promise* will jump back mid and cast **Release**. Once the knockback is done, take position to avoid the primals attacks.

**Maleficium** will be next followed by another **Formless Judgement**. Swap tanks during the cast and use the available invulnerability.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SKingsblaze-Lionsblaze'></a>

*Eden's Promise* will now cast **Stock** before going into the Lion's phase.

The main tank shall keep the boss facing North until *Eden's Promise* casts **Rapturous Reach**.

Everyone has to move to the safe side, before going to their assigned position once **Rapturous Reach** is done.
Tethered players will move to the opposite side of their Lion and keep this positions to bait every **Lionsblazes**.  
Meanwhile the other players will separate into two pairs North and South. The melee stays in melee range and can even go inside one **Lionsblaze** to be sure to not get targeted by the King. At the same time, the ranged bait **Kingblaze** toward the left (or the right) of the King.

Quickly regroup mid to get healed and get ready for **Laser Eye**.
Everyone should use their knockback immunity to stay in place, while the melee will move under the big King and hug the previous puddle to bait **Kingsblaze** toward the outside of the arena. The ranged must stay in melee range to avoid baiting the **Kingsblaze** and getting hit by the **Lionsblazes**.

After the Lions attacks, *Eden's Promise* will cast **Release**. Position yourself to dodge the primal abilities and move back to your position, with the ranged North and South baiting the last **Kingsblaze**:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="lion1.jpg;lion2.jpg;lion3.jpg" imgDesc="First Lion;Second Lion;Third Lion" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Right after the last attack from the Lions, *Eden's Promise* will cast **Rapturous Reach**.

**Maleficium** will be used by *Eden's Promise* before casting **Stock**.

The boss will now perform **Junction Shiva** or **Junction Titan** followed by a **Cast**. Move to the safe spot created by **Cast** and dodge the **Junction Shiva/Titan**.

Another **Maleficium** from *Eden's Promise*.

Now, *Eden's Promise* will cast **Junction Titan** or **Junction Shiva** that wasn't casted just before.
Immediately after, **Release** will be casted. Avoid the memories that was stored previously and dodge the incoming **Junction Titan/Shiva**.

*Eden's Promise* will cast the last **Formless Judgement** soon after. Swap tanks during the cast and use the available invulnerability.

*Eden's Promise* will cast two **Maleficiums** in row and finish with the enrage, **Paradise Lost**.
