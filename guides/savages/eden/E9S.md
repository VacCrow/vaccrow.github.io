*Cloud of Darkness* begins the fight with **Ground-razing Particle Beam** followed by **The Art of Darkness** with two orbs or no orb followed by a second **The Art of Darkness** using the pattern she didn’t use before.
Next cast is **Devouring Dark**, you may use your Tank invulnerability.

The layout wil be switch with **Obscure Wood**.

Preposition yourself for **Flood of Obscurity** and use your knockback immunity to stay at your assigned spot. Once your *Evil Seed* is dropped, move a step in to get sucked to death by the seed.

*Cloud of Darkness* will be tether to two trees with **Rejuvenating Balm**. Quickly identify the safe spot and when the <span class="speDebuff">Thorny Vines</span> appear, move to your safe spot to break the <span class="speDebuff">Thorny Vines</span>.

Movements if **Rejuvenating Balm** is tethering the East and West trees:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}

Movements if **Rejuvenating Balm** is tethering the North and South trees:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="briar1.jpg;briar2.jpg;briar3NS.jpg;briar4NS.jpg;briar5NS.jpg" imgDesc="Drop your <em>Evil Seed</em>;Step in;Identify the safe spots;Tanks/Healers move West and DPS move East;Ranged DPS and Healer have to move a bit further to break their <em>Thorny Vines</em>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Cloud of Darkness* will cast either **Wide-angle Unlimited Phaser** or **Anti-air Unlimited Phaser**.

**Wide-angle Unlimited Phaser**:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="wide1.jpg;wide2.jpg;wide3.jpg" imgDesc="Go to her sides to dodge the cleave;Tanks rotate mid to get their cleave alone, Healers share with their DPS;Move away from <em>Cloud of Darkness</em>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

**Anti-air Unlimited Phaser**:

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="antiair1.jpg;antiair2.jpg;antiair3.jpg" imgDesc="Move away from <em>Cloud of Darkness</em>;Tanks position themself in front and to the right of the boss.

Bring *Cloud of Darkness* back to the middle, before she cast another **Ground-razing Particle Beam**. 
Then **The Second Art of Darkness** will be casted:
+ **First Art of Darkness**: one orb on her left or right side.
+ **Second Art of Darkness**: two orbs or no orb.

*Cloud of Darkness* will cast **Wide-angle Unlimited Phaser** or **Anti-air Unlimited Phaser**. The one she didn’t cast previously.

Next cast is **Devouring Dark**, you may use your Invunerability.

Finally **Empty Floor** is casted, switching to the tile layout and going into the next phase.
</div>

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<a id="SPhase 2"></a>

*For this phase, players starting in the inner circle tiles will be referred as “melees” while the one starting outside will be referred as “ranged”.*

During **Flood of Emptiness**, everyone should get their starting position.

*Cloud of Darkness* will then summon the clouds with **Hypercharged Condensation**. The DPS/Healers have to kill them as quickly as possible.

When there's around 5s left on the Curse of Darkness debuff, melees will move to their intercardinal tile to allow the ranged to move in with the cloud. Then look away from any players, toward the outside for <span class="speDebuff">Curse of Darkness</span>. Finish the clouds if they aren't dead yet.

Everyone should already be in position for the incoming **Full-Perimeter Particles Beam**. Remember to stand close to the boss as it will also cleave the back part of the inner tiles.
Once **Full-Perimeter Particles Beam** happens, take your time move back to your starting position. You can wait for the tiles to turn into purple before moving.

**The Art of Darkness** is the next cast.
During the casting time of 10 seconds, everyone will have to position themself in the safe side of the arena:
+ The North and South melees will move one tile toward the safe spot.
+ The melee in the danger zone will move to the North inner tile.
+ The ranged in the danger zone will then move to the South inner tile.

<ins>Players in the North-South axis must stand on the safe side of their tile since **Art of Darkness** will cut their tile in half.</ins>

Once the cleave happens, everyone will go back to their starting position.
Then, have everyone move one tile, so the whole party is standing on the inner tiles.

*Cloud of Darkness* will cast **The Art of Darkness** with two orbs or no orb:
+ If there's no orb, get away from anyone but stay on your tile.
+ If there's two orbs, each pair will get close to each other but still on their own tile.
After the attack, move one tile to reset the timer if necessary.

**Deluge of Darkness** will then be casted, switching to the normal layout.

*Cloud of Darkness* will cast **Summon** followed by **The Art of Darkness** with one orb that will be replicated by the clones. Find the safe spot covering 1/8th of the arena.

**Devouring Dark** is next, this one needs to be Tank swapped since no invulnerability should be up.

Then **The Third Art of Darkness** will be casted:
+ **First Art of Darkness**: one orb on her left or right side.
+ **Second Art of Darkness**: two orbs or no orb.
+ **Third Art of Darkness**: one orb, opposite side of the first.

**Obscure Woods** will be cast, switching back to the wood layout and putting an end to this phase.
</div>

<div class="guideSection" markdown="1">
<a id="SPhase 3"></a>

First cast will be **Flood of Obscurity**. Handle the knockback and place the Evil Seeds the same way as in phase 1.

Once the *Evil Seeds* are dropped, *Cloud of Darkness* will cast **Particle Concentration**.
To break their <span class="speDebuff">Thorny Vines</span> Tanks/Healers will move to the South while DPS will move to the North. Then everyone move to their designated tower:
<img class="soloImg" src="{{ page.imagePath | append: "particleConcentration.jpg" }}">

Right after that, a **Wide-angle Unlimited Phaser** or **Anti-air Unlimited Phaser** will be casted, followed by **Ground-razing Particle Beam** afterwards. Move as shown in Phase 1.

Then *Cloud of Darkness* will tether to two trees with **Rejuvenating Balm** and will ink up with **The Second Art of Darkness**:
+ 1st: one orb on her left or right side.
+ 2nd: two orbs or no orb.

**Rejuvenating Balm** and the first Art of Darkness will happen at the same time, dodge accordingly. After the **Rejuvenating Balm** resolve, immediately pairs up or spread to do **The Second Art of Darkness**.

Last **Devouring Dark** of the fight, use invulnerability.

**Empty Floor** is cast again, switching to the tile layout.

*Cloud of Darkness* will then repeat the mechanics from phase 2.

She will cast **Flood of Emptiness**, destroying the tiles, then she will summon the clouds with **Hypercharged Condensation**.

Next is **Full-Perimeter Particles Beam**, everyone must move in close range.

*Cloud of Darkness* will then cast **The Art of Darkness** with one orb. Once this one is done, she will cast another one with two orbs or none.
These two **Art of Darkness** will be repeated again in the same order.

The enrage will then be casted, **Deluge of Darkness**.
