<h2><a id='ABSingularApocalypse'>Singular Apocalypse:</a></h2>

After the cast, the floor of the arena will roughly change to this (the red line is white ingame):
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'E12SApocalypseArena.jpg' }}'>

___

+ **<ins>Apocalypse</ins>:**
An orb of light will appear in the ground in the middle of the arena. It will shine for a brief moment before moving to one of the newly appeared circles along the edge. Again, it will shine for a bit and will start to rotate along the hard line (in red on the diagram). Each time it comes across a circle, it will stop to shine before resuming its course. Once the orb has done the full circle, it will shine one last time and disappear.  
Afterward, big AoEs dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> will occur at every stop the orb of light has made. It starts with an initial explosion in the middle followed by 9 explosions in a row along the red line.

___

+ **<ins>Cataclysm</ins>:**
*Oracle of Darkness* turns toward the first circle met by the orb of light and starts casting. At the end of the cast, she will jump to that circle and perform a big aoe, dealing <span class='phys'>physical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span>. The opposite side behind the red line is safe.

___

+ **<ins>Black Halo</ins>:**
*Oracle of Darkness* will cleave the main target (with a hammer /shrug) dealing <span class='phys'>physical damage</span> that must be shared by the tanks. An invulnerability can also be used.

___

  + **Spell-in-Waiting Return IV** on everyone, lasting 12 seconds.

  The next debuffs can be separated into 3 groups where each player will recieve one debuff from each group. Each group's debuff will randomly last 23, 27 or 31 seconds:
  + **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Eruption** on everyone.

  + **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Blizzard III** on either all Tanks/Healers or all DPS and **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Aero III** on the other players (that didn't get **SiW Blizzard III**).

<h2><a id='ABTripleApocalypse'>Triple Apocalypse:</a></h2>

Three orbs of lights will spawn. One middle and two on the outside. The middle one will move toward the outside and rotate in the opposite direction compared to the two other ones. This example can be mirrored left/right and since the middle orb can move anywhere, it can also be rotated:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'tripleApo0.jpg' }}'>

During the first explosions, *Oracle of Darkness* will use **Darkest Dance**. Once all explosions are done, she will use **Black Halo**.

<h2><a id='ABTerminalRelativity'>Terminal Relativity:</a></h2>

+ **<ins>Advanced Relativity</ins>:** raid-wide dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> scaling on the number of player dead and applying 3 **Spell-in-Waiting Quietus** to every players with various durations.  
While the **SiW Quietus** are resolving the boss will cast 3 **Shockwave Pulsar** over 30 seconds. Each cast of **Shockwave Pulsar** will give a <span class='buff'>Damage Up</span> buff to *Oracle Of Darkness*.

</div>

<h1><a id='Strategy'>Strategy</a></h1>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
The boss can be pulled South to minimize movement.

*Oracle of Darkness* starts with **Hell's Judgement** into **Shockwave Pulsar**. Since **Hell's Judgement** doesn't remove shields, you can shield heavily during pre-pull and keep them for **Shockwave Pulsar**.

Then *Oracle Of Darkness* will cast either **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Eruption** on everyone or **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Water III** on both Healers. You can already spread or stack in two groups while she's casting the second Spell-in-Waiting, the one she didn't cast right before.

Once the first Spell-in-Waiting happens, everyone has to stand inside *Oracle of Darkness* hitbox while the off-tank will move outside her hitbox in front of her to bait **Darkest Dance**. Then move behind her for the incoming knockback.  
If the remaining Spell-in-Waiting is Dark Water III, you can already regroup and get knocked with your group.  
Otherwise for Eruption, after the knockback, the melee can dash in. The Tanks will position themself North East/West and the DPS South East/West of the boss to avoid retard clipping things wink wink.

Another **Shockwave Pulsar** will be casted.

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SBasicRelativity'></a>

*Oracle Of Darkness* will cast **Basic Relativity**.

> For the rest of this phase, **Anger's Hourglass** (the yellow one) will be considered as True North.

*Oracle Of Darkness* will **Speed**, speeding up the East and West **Joy's Hourglass**. She will also randomly slow down either the North or South **Joy's Hourglasses**. Tanks have to memorize which hourglasses will fire last:

{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="basic0PresetNorth.jpg;basic0PresetSouth.jpg" imgDesc="North hourglasses fire last;South hourglasses fire last" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The DPS with **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Blizzard III** will move to the East and West **Joy's Hourglasses** to bait the first **Dark Currents** toward the South. The rest of the group will regroup between the boss and **Anger's Hourglass**.
If the **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Fire III** expires first, the DPS with this debuff have to move to the South to avoid any clipping at max melee range:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="basic1Blizz1st.jpg;basic1Fire1st.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Blizzard III</strong> resolve first;<strong>Fire III</strong> resolve first" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Once these mechanics are done, the DPS will move back with the group to prepare for **Spell-in-Waiting Return**. The Healers will move to the sides to bait the second **Dark Currents** without lasering the group. Use this moment to apply raid-wide mitigation and heals/shields.  
Right before the **Spell-in-Waiting Return** resolves, the Tanks have to move toward **Anger's Hourglass** to later absorb the damage from **Empty Hate**. And everyone has to look away from the **Spell-in-Waiting Shadoweye** players:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="basic2LasersSouth.jpg;basic2LasersNorth.jpg" imgDesc="North hourglasses fire last;South hourglasses fire last" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Once the **Return** puddles are dropped, the Tanks will move near the **Joy's Hourglasses** that fire last and bait the last **Dark Currents** away from the group.
The rest of the group shall move South to avoid the **Empty Rage** and stack on top of each other to automatically resolve **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Blizzard III** if it's happening now.  
If **Spell-in-Waiting Dark Fire III** is resolving now, the two DPS shall move to the sides of the group:

<a id='SSingularApocalypse'></a>

*Oracle Of Darkness* will cast **Singular Apocalypse** dealing no damage.

> Let's consider for this example that the orb of light will first move to the West then rotate in a clockwise manner.

*Oracle Of Darkness* will face the first circle the orb of light encounters and cast **Cataclysm**, everyone will move to the opposite side to avoid **Cataclysm**.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="singApo1.jpg;singApo2.jpg" imgDesc="The group move to the opposite side where <em>Oracle of Darkness</em> is facing;She jumps and perform <strong>Catatlysm</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Immediately after, the ranged will stay at this position while the melees will move in. They have to move to the safe side to avoid the three first explosions (South West in our example), being at max melee range is enough to avoid the second explosion under the boss. The main tank will move and use his invulnerability on **Black Halo** and aim it toward the outside:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'singApo3.jpg' }}'>

Immediately after, the main tank will move back with the melee and once the middle explosion happens, everyone will regroup on the boss for the incoming **Shell Crusher**:

**Shockwave Pulsar** incoming, because there is news that gives you a smile.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SIntermediateRelativity'></a>

*Oracle Of Darkness* will cast Intermediate Relativity. Think to mitigate the damage accordingly.

*Let's consider for this example that the debuffs will resolve in this order **Aero III/Blizzard III => Eruptions => Flares/Shadoweyes/Unholy Darkness**.*  
**<u>For the following positions, ALWAYS use your usual spread position.</u>**

Once the debuffs are assigned, quickly identify which set of debuffs is resolved last (**Flares/Shadoweyes/Unholy Darkness** in our example) and move to the set positions for these debuffs.  
If DPS got SiW Flare, they should occupy their cardinal spread position instead.  
The one with **Unholy Darkness** mustn't be in the middle but slightly toward his spread position to be able to avoid the Shadoweye:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'interFlarePos.jpg' }}'>

Once the **Return IV** puddle is dropped, identify the second set of debuff(s) to resolve (**Dark Eruptions** here) and move to the according position:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'interErupPos.jpg' }}'>

Once the **Return** puddle is dropped, move into position for the first set of debuff(s) to happen.  
If Tanks/Healers got **SiW Aero III**, they should occupy their cardinal spread position:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'interAeroBlizzPos.jpg' }}'>

<u>When you get in position for the last set of debuff(s) everyone has to look away from the middle of the arena based on their spread position to be sure to avoid the Shadoweye.</u>  
So for example, someone on the South West spread position has to look away toward the South West direction.

Soon after the first set will resolve. Then everyone will get stunned and teleported to their **Return** puddle when the second set resolves. Finally, everyone is teleported to their **Return IV** puddle for the last set to resolve:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="interAeroBlizzResolv.jpg;interErupResolv.jpg;interFlareResolv.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Aero III & Blizzard III</strong> resolve;Everyone is teleported for <strong>Dark Eruption</strong> to resolve;<strong>Flares, Shadoweyes & Unholy Darkness</strong> resolve after the second teleport" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Annnnnnnnnnnnnd **Shockwave Pulsar**, yay.

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SDualApocalypse'></a>

*Oracle Of Darkness* will cast **Dual Apocalypse** dealing no damage.

> Let's consider for this example that the orbs of light will move to the East and West then rotate in a clockwise manner.

*Oracle Of Darkness* will then face a random cardinal direction to cast **Cataclysm**, everyone will move to the opposite side  to avoid it:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dualApo1.jpg;dualApo2.jpg" imgDesc="" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Immediately after, the ranged will stay at this position while the melees will move in. They have to move to the safe side to avoid the two first explosions (South West in our example), being at max melee range is enough to avoid the second explosion under the boss.  
If you're feeling confident about the timing to move between the first and the second explosion and doesn't want to take care of the orbs of light positions, you can use the position showed for the gunbreaker (and flexing).  
Once the middle explosions happens, everyone has to group in the middle:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dualApo3.jpg;dualApo4.jpg" imgDesc="" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

After the third explosion, the main Tank will move toward the edge to bait **Somber Dance** being casted. Use the lines on the ground to avoid the explosion.
Once the boss jumped, the other Tank will move under the boss while avoiding the last explosion to bait the second part of **Somber Dance**. The main Tank has to move to group to avoid dying:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dualApo5.jpg;dualApo6.jpg;dualApo7.jpg;dualApo8.jpg" imgDesc="The main Tank prepares to move;He moves toward the edge while avoid the fourth explosion;<em>Oracle of Darkness</em> jumps on the Tank;The other Tank remplace him to get the second hit of <strong>Somber Dance</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Afterward, the Tanks regroup for the incoming **Shell Crusher**. Heal the damage taken and spread around *Oracle of Darkness* for **Spirit Taker**. :

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dualApo9.jpg;dualApo10.jpg" imgDesc="Regroup for the incoming share;Spread to avoid overlap" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When you end a major mechanic, who do you call? **Shockwave Pulsar** :^).

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SAdvancedRelativity'></a>

*Oracle Of Darkness* will cast **Advanced Relativity**. Remember to mitigate accordingly.
During Advanced Relativity, you can already regroup North and South based on your North/South group.

Once the debuffs are dispatched, adjust the group so there's a double **SiW Aero III** in each group. Only DPS have to swap group since, if **SiW Aero III** are on Tanks/Healers, it will always affect both Tanks or both Healers, so you will always have a double **SiW Aero III** in each group.

> For this phase, use the white lines on the ground to help you to position yourself.

When **Speed** is casted, each group will move toward the yellow tethered hourglass on their side. The **Speed** tethers will always happen so opposite hourglasses will have the same fill speed.  
The group will stack behind their hourglass and behind the two circle lines while the player with double **SiW Aero III** will move a bit further toward the edge:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'advance1.jpg' }}'>

Keep these positions until the **SiW Water III** resolve and the **Return IV** puddles are dropped.
Then the players with SiW Shadoweye will rotate counterclockwise while the others will rotate clockwise. Everyone will stop before crossing the circle lines:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'advance2.jpg' }}'>

Wait there until the **Return** puddles are dropped on the ground. Then all **SiW Aero III** players will move forward a few steps and cross the white line while the **SiW Fire III** will move further to positions themself as shown:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'advance3.jpg' }}'>

<u>When you get in position for the last set of debuffs everyone has to look away from the middle of the arena.</u>

Soon after, the first **Maelstroms** and the **SiW AeroIII/Fire III** will resolve. Everyone will get stunned and teleported to the **Return** puddles and the **SiW Shadoweye** will happen. Finally, everyone is now teleported to their **Return IV** puddles and the last **SiW Aero III**:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="advance4.jpg;advance5.jpg;advance6.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Aero III & Fire III</strong> resolve;Everyone is teleported for <strong>Shadoweye</strong>;<strong>AeroIII</strong> resolve after the second teleport" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Everyone caught in the **Aero III** will be knocked away to opposite side of the arena, ready to stack for the remaining **SiW Water III**:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'advance7.jpg' }}'>

*Oracle Of Darkness* will use **Shockwave Pulsar** after the last **SiW Water III**.

> Let's consider for this example that the middle orb of light will move to the North then rotate clockwise.

Once the orbs of lights appear, the group will follow the middle one and stack on its third explosion while being safe from the first explosion. Don't forget to cross the line to be safe from the second explosion.  
The tank bating the first part of **Darkest Dance** will move to the edge between the third explosions from the middle orb and the South orb:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="tripleApo1.jpg;tripleApo2.jpg" imgDesc="Stack on the third explosion and away from the center;The Tank move to the edge to bait <strong>Darkest Dance</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

After the first explosion, the group will immediately move mid, safe from the other explosions. The tank have to wait for **Darkest Dance** to happen before moving in:

Then everyone will stack behind *Oracle of Darkness* in order to get knocked to the opposite side. Use the lines on the ground to not get knocked into the explosion on the other side:

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="tripleApo4.jpg;tripleApo5.jpg" imgDesc="Everyone stack behind the boss;Get knocked away to one of the safe spots" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Oracle Of Darkness* will then cast **Shockwave Pulsar** followed by **Black Halo**. Remember to swap to use the other Tank invulnerability.
