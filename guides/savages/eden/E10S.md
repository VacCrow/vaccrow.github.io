<h2><a id='ABShadowsAbilities'>Shadow's Abilities</a></h2>

The effects from **Implosion** and **Giga Slash** will never come from *Shadowkeeper* but from the shadows he summoned beforehand or from the **Shadow Servant**.
When the cast is over, the attack will be performed from the shadow based on its direction. The shadow will always refer as if it was the back of the boss.

___

+ **<ins>Implosion</ins>:**
Front or back cleave dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> applying a <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> debuff.
If he raises his head and it starts to glow, it will be a front cleave. If he raises his tail and it starts to glow, it will be a back cleave.

___

+ **<ins>Giga Slash</ins>:**
Left or right cleave dealing <span class='phys'>physical damage</span> applying a <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> debuff.
If he raises his sword to the left, it will be a left cleave. If he raises his sword to the right, it will be a right cleave.

___

+ **<ins>Shadow Servant</ins>:**
*Shadowkeeper* will attach his shadow to four Tanks/Healers or four DPS. Each shadow will face a different cardinal direction and will perform the **Giga Slash** that will follow.
To know which direction your shadow is facing, put the shadow behind your back, your character now faces the same direction as the shadow. The shadow direction is independent of your character direction.
Once the shadows have attacked, the other group of player is targeted.

___

+ **<ins>Spawn Shadow</ins>:**
*Shadowkeeper* will spawn four shadow clones on the cardinals with one tethered to him.

___

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<h2><a id='ABGeneralAbilities'>General Abilities</a></h2>

+ **<ins>Deepshadow Nova</ins>:**
Raid-wide AoE dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span>.

___

+ **<ins>Umbra Slash</ins>:**
Four-hits tank buster dealing slashing <span class='phys'>physical damage</span>. Also apply a <span class='debuff'>Slashing Resistance Down</span> (stackable) and a <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span> debuff for each hit. Always followed by **Shadow's Edge** or **Darkness Unleashed**.

___

+ **<ins>Shadow's Edge</ins>:**
AoE line tank buster dealing slashing <span class='phys'>physical damage</span> that must be taken by the tank that doesn't have <span class='debuff'>Slashing Resistance Down</span>.

___

+ **<ins>Darkness Unleashed</ins>:**

___

+ **<ins>Shadow Cleave</ins>:**
Cone AoE from the boss toward each player dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span>.
At the location where a player is hit, a shadow clone will appear and be tethered to their owner and applying the <span class='speDebuff'>Shadowed</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.E10S.Shadowed }}'> debuff.  
The shadow has a few rules:
  + If a player stands too close from his shadow, it will cleave its owner and kill him.
  + The cleave can also kill other players.
  + <span class='speDebuff'>Shadowed</span> will reflect any damage/debuff dealt to the shadow to their owner.
  + Other's player shadow won't cleave you, so you can go near them.
  + Shadows can't cleave each other.

___

+ **<ins>Dualspell</ins>:**
One player will be targeted with a stack maker dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> that will explode three times.  
While six other players will have their shadow targeted by a buster dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span>. These shadow will have a number of dots, from 1 to 3, on top of them. The buster will go off following the dots order.
The stack explosion will be synced with the buster based on the dots numbers, meaning that the Xth stack explosion will happen at the same as the Xth buster. So since the first buster will happen at the same time as the first stack explosion, player with the “1” dot cannot stack for the first share, etc.

___

+ **<ins>Shadowkeeper</ins>:**
Every shadow from **Shadow Cleave** will appear behind their owner and cleave the direction they're facing.

___

+ **<ins>Umbral Orbs</ins>:**

___

+ **<ins>Voidgate</ins>:**
Four voidgates will spawn. Each gate needs two players when it resolves or it will deal raidwide damage and apply <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span>?).
While standing in a voidgate, you'll receive a small <span class='debuff'>Bleeding</span> debuff.

___

+ **<ins>Pitch Bog</ins>:**
AoE on every player. After a few seconds will resolve, deal <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and apply a <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span> and drop a puddle on the ground.

A green/red tether between every Tanks/Healers and DPS along with a <span class='speDebuff'>Shackled Together</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.E10S.ShackledTogether }}'> debuff. If tethered players are too far from each other, they'll die.

___

+ **<ins>Voidgate Amplified</ins>:**
Same mechanic as **Voidgate** but with 8 towers instead of only 4. Requires to have shadows inside towers to make up for the lack of players.
If a tower isn't soaked properly, a <span class='speDebuff'>Thrice-come Ruin</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.E10S.ThriceComeRuin }}'> debuff and a <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> will be applied to everyone.

*Shadowkeeper* will start with **Deepshadow Nova**, that can be pre-shielded, the boss will continue with a simple **Implosion**.

Once you dodged it, the boss will use **Throne of Shadow** to switch stance so get away from him:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'throne.jpg' }}'>

It is followed by a simple **Giga Slash**.

*Shadowkeeper* will cast Umbra Slash on the main target, use your invulnerability and swap tank after the fourth hit. Then either stack with the rest of the group if **Darkness Unleashed** is casted or mitigate alone if **Shadow's Edge** is casted.

Everyone spread to its position near the edge for the cast of **Shadow Cleave** (melee can stand at max melee range to keep uptime). Once the shadows spawn, immediately move back to the middle to avoid being cleaved by them.

When **Dualcast** starts, the stack marker will move under the boss along with the player with nothing. The “dots” player will move inside the stack if and only if their dot number isn't the same as the explosion number (i.e., players with dots “2” won't stack for the 2nd explosion but will soak the the 1st and 3rd shares).

{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="cleave1.jpg;cleave2.jpg;cleave3.jpg;cleave4.jpg;cleave5.jpg;cleave6.jpg;cleave7.jpg" imgDesc="Spread around the boss;Enjoy;Move back to the middle;Look at your shadow to see if you get a number;Everyone but '1' stack;Everyone but '2' stack;Everyone but '3' stack" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

After the shares, *Shadowkeeper* will cast **Shadowkeeper**, everyone stays stacked on the boss' back. The shadows will teleport behind everyone, facing the boss.
Once they spawn, everyone must move to the sides of the boss or behind the shadows to avoid the cleave.

Next is the second tank buster **Umbra Slash**, use an invulnerability and swap tank as before. Then stack for **Darkness Unleashed** or mitigate **Shadow's Edge** alone.

*Shadowkeeper* will cast **Shadow Servant** and will attach his shadow to the Tanks/Healers or the DPS. Then he will cast **Giga Sword** that will be performed by the shadows.
Players without a shadow will stand under the boss while the other will position in melee range around the boss so their shadow will cleave toward the outside of the arena.
Here is an example with Giga Sword cleaving the right side:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'servant.jpg' }}'>

*Shadowkeeper* will repeat **Giga Sword** but will target the other players with **Shadow Servant**.

*Shadowkeeper* will use **Distant Scream** to change stance. Use your knockback immunity to avoid being pushed into the wall or get pushed into a corner.

Coming next is **Umbral Orbs**. Tanks will take care of purple orbs while the East and West group will get the oranges orbs.
You can use a priority system to assign the orbs. Starting from North:

+ For purple orb: the main Tank rotate anti-clockwise and takes the one he find while the second Tank rotate clockwise and take the first on his path.
+ For orange orbs: West group rotate rotate anti-clockwise and take the first orbs found and the East group takes the first group while rotating clockwise.

*Shadowkeeper* will cast **Spawn Shadow**, **Shadow Warrior** and **Umbrals Orb** in succession.
To quickly find the safe spot, you only have to take attention to the last jump:

+ If the tethered shadow is East and the shadows keep jumping in the same direction (clockwise), the safe spot will be South, while if the last jump is counter-clockwise, the safe spot will be North.

Once you find the safe spot behind the tethered shadow, reach while looking for your orb(s):

+ While facing the boss, the main Tank can take the leftmost orb and the other Tank the rightmost. The West group can take the leftmost orange group while the East group will take the rightmost group.  

Try to be in line with your orb(s) to insure that they will dash toward you and not another group.

> You can also not care about **Shadow Warrior**. Use a lot of mitigations and shield to reduce the damage of **Shadow Warrior** to 0, avoiding the <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> at the same time. Giving you way enough time to find your **Umbral Orbs** position.

The boss will then cast **Deepshadow Nova** into **Fade to Shadow**. After a few seconds, **Implosion** will be casted, reducing the number of **Fade to Shadow** safe spots from 2 to 1. After the first set of **Fade to Shadow** happens, move to the closest adjacent inter-cardinal to avoid the second set.

*Shadowkeeper* will cast **Deepshadow Nova** followed by four **Implosion** in a row and each time from a different shadow. Avoid them in order.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase2'></a>

Another **Deepshadow Nova** because it's free estate **Throne of Shadow**, so step back away when it happens.  
He will continue with an **Umbral Smash**, except no invulnerability will be up so mitigate accordingly and swap after the fourth slash. Then stack for **Darkness Unleashed** or mitigate **Shadow's Edge** alone.

*Shadowkeeper* will cast **Voidgate**, and four gates will appear. He will also cast **Shadow Servant** along with a **Giga Slash**.
The players without a shadow will stand into their assigned gate, while the players with a shadows will position themself to cleave the outside of the arena and inside a tower :

The gates resolve before the **Giga Slash**, so you can soak the tower then move under the boss to avoid the **Giga Slash**.

Once the gates are resolved, another set of gates will appear. And another **Shadow Servant** will be casted, targeting the four players that weren't targeted before.
From the previous tower positions, everyone will move to the next tower clockwise.
Once the towers resolve, the players with a shadow will position their shadow to cleave the outside :

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="voidgate1-1.jpg;voidgate1-2.jpg;voidgate1-3.jpg" imgDesc="First set, here with a <strong>Giga Slash</strong> toward the right;Step into the next clockwise tower for the second set;Position your shadow, here with a <strong>Giga Slash</strong> toward the left" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

**Pitch Bog** will then be casted. Drop the puddles along the edges.
*Shadowkeeper* will cast **Umbral Orbs** and will switch stance with **Distant Scream** before the orbs resolve. Everyone should get to his orbs position and use their knockback immunity to avoid being pushed away from his group or into a puddle.

Afterward, two **Implosions** will be casted followed by a **Deepshadow Nova**.

*Shadowkeeper* will use **Shackled Appart**, have Tanks and Healers regroup North of the boss and DPS South thus respecting the tethers conditions (melees should stand at max melee range for safety reasons).
Then,**Fade to Shadow** will be casted with **Umbral Orbs**. Two safe spots will be designated on opposite inter-cardinals.  
Each group will move to the closest safe spot (1). Once the first explosion occurs, the tethers will disappear and the groups will have to move in the same direction toward the next safe spot (2):
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'shackles.jpg' }}'>

Shortly after that, follow the same callouts as the first **Umbral Orbs** and move to your positions in melee range around the boss.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase3'></a>

**Deepshadow Nova** next because why not? Followed by a **Throne of Shadow**, so stay away.

For the next **Pitch Bog**, put the puddles at these locations:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'amplified1.jpg' }}'>

Once the puddles are done, **Giga Slash** will be performed 4 times. Regroup mid and avoid the slashes.

When *Shadowkeeper* has finished, he will cast **Voidgate Amplified**. At the same moment, players have to walk into a puddle to make the shadows spawn.  
> CAREFUL: Tanks and DPS on inter-cardinal have to take puddles horizontally opposite to the one they placed (i.e. If you put your **Pitch Bog** North East, walk into the North West puddle).

Instantly move away to avoid getting cleave by your shadow. Right after, **Shadowkeeper** will be casted, move in front of your assigned tower so that your shadow will teleport behind you, inside the tower. Don't greed this and put it properly.

Then move quickly to the next clockwise tower to avoid the shadow's cleaves and soak the towers.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="amplified2.jpg;amplified3.jpg;amplified4.jpg;amplified5.jpg;amplified6.jpg" imgDesc="Step into the correct puddle;Move away from your shadow;Go to your assigned tower with your back facing the tower;Wait for the shadow to spawn behind you;Move into the next clockwise tower" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Once the towers are soaked, a new set of towers will appear. Don't move until the AoE from **Shadowy Eruption** has been baited. Try to bait them at max melee range as much as you can to avoid any problem.

DPS then move under the boss to avoid the AoE while the tanks and healers will rotate to the next clockwise tower.

Each DPS will tether with **Shackled Together** to a Tank/Healer, rejoin your tether partner inside the tower.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="amplified7.jpg;amplified8.jpg;amplified9.jpg;amplified10.jpg" imgDesc="Bait the <strong>Shadowy Eruption</strong> at max melee range;DPS move in and Tanks/Healers rotate clockwise;DPS find their tether partner;Move inside the tower with them to soak" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Last **Umbra Smash** incoming, use you invulnerability and swap as usual. Followed by **Darkness Unleashed** or **Shadow's Edge**.

Last mechanic is **Umbral Orbs**. He will switch stance with **Distant Scream** before the orbs resolve, so go to your group of orb(s) and use your knockback immunity to soak the orb as always.

There's three **Deepshadow Nova** before he starts casting his enrage **Doom Arc**.
