*Kokytos* will mark the four orbs along with four random players with numbers from 1 to 8. Orbs will be numbered with 1, 3, 5 and 7 in a (counter)clockwise manner and players will be numbered with 2, 4, 6 and 8.  

  *Kokytos* will teleport behind the next orb and will kick it to the opposite side. When the orb reaches the opposite wall, it explodes in a small AoE, named **Shock**, dealing lightning <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'>Lightning Resistance Down II</span> debuff for 10 seconds and a <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> debuff.

The fight starts with **Gluttony's Augur** into **Ravening**. Remember to mitigate the damage from **Soul Surge** after **Ravening**.

Then *Kokytos* will cast **Duality of Death**, swap Tanks during the cast.

*Kokytos* will then cast 3 **Dualspell** in a row:

+ The first one will be **Fire/Ice**, regroup in pairs (one Tank/Healer and one DPS) and either move out is <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span> is amplified or in if <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> is amplified.
+ The second one will be **Thunder/Ice**, spread around the boss and  move out is <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Thunder</strong></span> is amplified or in if <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> is amplified.
+ The third one will be **Fire/Ice**, regroup in pairs and move out is <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span> is amplified or in if <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> is amplified. It will be the opposite of the first one.

Heal and mitigate for the next **Ravening** / **Soul Surge**.

*Kokytos* will launch **Ascendant Fist** on the main target. Either swap tanks or use an invulnerability to nullify the <span class='debuff'>Physical Vulnerability Up</span> debuff.

Then regroup in pairs in front of a wall that spawned and use the **Shockwave** to get knocked into the wall and resolve the **Archaic Rockbreaker** share at the same time.

Then the boss will cast either **Front Combination** or **Rear Combination** along with **Inside/Outside Roundhouse**. Either move in or out based of the **Roundhouse** and dodge the **Archaic Rockbreaker** AoEs that will spawn on the ground.  
Then move either in front or behind the boss based on the cast name.  
And quickly move out or in to dodge the second part of the **Roundhouse** and avoid the second set of **Archaic Rockbreaker**. Be careful since the second set combined with the **Roundhouse** and **Swinging Kick** leaves small safe spots.

Once it's done, quickly heal and regroup in light parties to share **Archaic Demolish**.

*Kokytos* will perform another **Gluttony's Augur** followed by **Ascendant Fist** into **Ravening** / **Soul Surge**, resolve them accordingly.

Finally *Kokytos* will cast **Levinstrike Summoning** summoning the four walls and orbs.  
During the **Scrambled Succession** cast, quickly identify the first orb location and how the orbs are ordered (clockwise or counter-clockwise):  

+ The players with number 2 and 6 will move in pair to the opposite side of the orb n°1 and the players with number 4 and 8 will move in pair to the opposite side of the orb n°3.  
  When an orb is kicked toward a pair, dodge the orb and the resulting **Shock** explosion when it reaches the wall.  
  Then the player who isn't the next target will soak the tower. While the next targeted player will get hit by **Firemeld** next to the tower.  
  Once it's done, rotate to the opposite side of the arena following the orb order (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Be careful to not be on the next **Firemeld** path but it should only happen if you're way too slow.

+ Players without a number will regroup in front of the orb n°1. When a player receive the **Icemeld** marker he will leave the group and position himself against the wall. The rest of the group will move into the next orb and repeat this process.  
  Once a player **Icemeld** resolves, this player must wait for the next **Icemeld** explosion before rejoining with that player. Repeat this until the last **Icemeld**

*Kokytos* will conclude this mechanic with **Two Minds** which is the same thing as **Dualspell** using the <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> element along with either <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span> or <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Thunder</strong></span>. Pair up or spread then move in or out based on element and amplification.

> **Two Minds** applies damage faster than **Dualspell**, otherwise it's the same ability.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase2'></a>

*Kokytos* will cast another **Glutonny's Augur** followed by **Ravening** / **Soul Surge**, remember to mitigate.

Next he will cast **Charybdis** on cardinals or intercardinals along with **Comet** on the remaining intercardinals or cardinals, stack middle to get healed and reduce the damage. Then the DPS will move away next to a cracked comet to bait the **Beastly Bile** while the Tanks and Healers will move inside the boss hitbox to bait **Thunderbolt** toward the wind puddles from **Charybdis**.  
Once the first set happen, the group will swap for the second set in order to destroy the second cracked comet.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="comet1.jpg;comet2.jpg" imgDesc="Tanks/Healers in aiming at tornadoes, DPS stack on a cracked comet;DPS in aiming at tornadoes, Tanks/Healers stack on a cracked comet" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Kokytos* will aim at a random comet with **Ecliptic Meteor**, hide behind the other one.

He will conclude with **Beastly Fury**, mitigate this one since it deals more damage than the other raidwides.

*Kokytos* will once again use **Ravening** / **Soul Surge** and follow up with **Duality of Death**, swap Tank as usual. Then regroup by pair and use **Shockwave** to get knocked into the wall to deal with **Archaic Rockbreaker**.  
It is immediately chained with the **Archaic Rockbreaker** lines on the ground and *Kokytos* will start casting a <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span>/<span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> **Dualspell**. Dodge the two sets of **Archaic Rockbreaker** ground AoEs <u>then</u> pair inside or outside the boss for **Dualspell**.

Afterward, *Kokytos* uses **Glutonny's Augur** before casting **Chimeric Succession**.  
The player with number 1 will stand on the NW of the arena while the player with number 2 will stand on the NE. The other players with a number will wait slightly South of the boss. When the first explosion happens, player number 3 replaces the number 1 and when the second explosion happens, player number 4 replaces the number 2.  
In the meantime, the players without a number will stack South to bait the **Front/Rear Firestrike**. Once it resolves, if it's **Front Firestrike** move toward the outside to bait **Swinging Kick** out, otherwise move toward the inside if it's **Rear Firestrike**.

*Kokytos* will dash back to the middle and cast a <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span>/<span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> or <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span>/<span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Thunder</strong></span> **Dualspell**.

Then *Kokytos* will perform a **Ravening** / **Soul Surge** starting the last part of the fight.

It begins with an <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span>/<span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Thunder</strong></span> **Dualspell** followed by **Glutonny's Augur**.  
Next is a <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span>/<span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> **Dualspell** into **Duality of Death**, swap Tanks as usual.  
Here comes the last **Dualspell** with <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span>/<span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Thunder</strong></span> elements linked with **Glutonny's Augur**.

Finally *Kokytos* will cast a last **Ravening** / **Soul Surge**, the enrage.
