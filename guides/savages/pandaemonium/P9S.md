The fight starts with **Gluttony's Augur** into **Ravening**. Remember to mitigate the damage from **Soul Surge** after **Ravening**.

Then *Kokytos* will cast **Duality of Death**, swap Tanks during the cast.

*Kokytos* will then cast 3 **Dualspell** in a row:

+ The first one will be **Fire/Ice**, regroup in pairs (one Tank/Healer and one DPS) and either move out is <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span> is amplified or in if <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> is amplified.
+ The second one will be **Thunder/Ice**, spread around the boss and  move out is <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Thunder</strong></span> is amplified or in if <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> is amplified.
+ The third one will be **Fire/Ice**, regroup in pairs and move out is <span style='color:firebrick'><strong>Fire</strong></span> is amplified or in if <span style='color: dodgerblue'><strong>Ice</strong></span> is amplified. It will be the opposite of the first one.

Heal and mitigate for the next **Ravening** / **Soul Surge**.

*Kokytos* will launch **Ascendant Fist** on the main target. Either swap tanks or use an invulnerability to nullify the <span class='debuff'>Physical Vulnerability Up</span> debuff.

Then regroup in pairs in front of a wall that spawned and use the **Shockwave** to get knocked into the wall and resolve the **Archaic Rockbreaker** share at the same time.

Then the boss will cast either **Front Combination** or **Rear Combination** along with **Inside/Outside Roundhouse**. Either move in or out based of the **Roundhouse** and dodge the **Archaic Rockbreaker** AoEs that will spawn on the ground.  
Then move either in front or behind the boss based on the cast name.  
And quickly move out or in to dodge the second part of the **Roundhouse** and avoid the second set of **Archaic Rockbreaker**. Be careful since the second set combined with the **Roundhouse** and **Swinging Kick** leaves small safe spots.

Once it's done, quickly heal and regroup in light parties to share **Archaic Demolish**.

*Kokytos* will perform another **Gluttony's Augur** followed by **Ascendant Fist** into **Ravening** / **Soul Surge**, resolve them accordingly.

Finally *Kokytos* will cast **Levinstrike Summoning** summoning the four walls and orbs.  
During the **Scrambled Succession** cast, quickly identify the first orb location and how the orbs are ordered (clockwise or counter-clockwise):  

+ The players with number 2 and 6 will move in pair to the opposite side of the orb n°1 and the players with number 4 and 8 will move in pair to the opposite side of the orb n°3.  
  When an orb is kicked toward a pair, dodge the orb and the resulting **Shock** explosion when it reaches the wall.  
  Then the player who isn't the next target will soak the tower. While the next targeted player will get hit by **Firemeld** next to the tower.  
  Once it's done, rotate to the opposite side of the arena following the orb order (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Be careful to not be on the next **Firemeld** path but it should only happen if you're way too slow.

+ Players without a number will regroup in front of the orb n°1. When a player receive the **Icemeld** marker he will leave the group and position himself against the wall. The rest of the group will move into the next orb and repeat this process.  
  Once a player **Icemeld** resolves, this player must wait for the next **Icemeld** explosion before rejoining with that player. Repeat this until the last **Icemeld**
