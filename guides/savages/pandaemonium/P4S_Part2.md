<a id='SAkanthaiAct1'></a>

The fight starts with **Searing Stream** immediately followed by **Akanthai: Act 1** and another **Searing Stream**.

Next is **Wreath Of Thorns**, identify which **Fire IV** will fire first:

+ If *Hesperos* is tethered to the North and South *Thorns* first, move the safe spot on East/West, then move into your assigned **Thunder III** towers, then move into the North/South safe spots.
+ If *Hesperos* is tethered to the East and West *Thorns* first, move the safe spot on North/South, then move into your assigned **Thunder III** towers, then move into the East/West safe spots.

Example with first **Fire IV** tethers on East/West:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="act1-1.jpg;act1-2.jpg;act1-3.jpg" imgDesc="Move to North/South;Soak <strong>Thunder III</strong> towers;Move to East/West" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Once **Act 1** is completed, the boss will cast **Nearsight** or **Farsight**:

+ **Nearsight**, the Tanks move North inside the boss' hitbox and the rest of the group move out of it, behind him.
+ **Farsight**, the Tanks move North outside the boss' hitbox and the rest of the group move inside, behind him.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SAkanthaiAct2'></a>

*Hesperos* will cast **Akanthai: Act 2** and when every mechanics are shown he will cast **Demigod Double**, use a Tank invulnerability.

Then the boss will cast **Wreath Of Thorns** into **Dark Design**. During **Dark Design** cast, everyone must be under the boss to bait the AoEs and the Tank and Healer with **Dark IV** tethers must bait on North East and South West.  
Then based on your tether and role assumed the following position:

+ **Dark IV** Healer has to stand at the edge between the South and West towers. Once the tether is broken, soak the first tower on South/West and the next clockwise tower.
+ **Dark IV** Tank has to stand at max melee range between the North and East towers . Once the tether is broken, move into the North/East melee safe spot and into the next counterclockwise safe spot.
<br/><br/><!-- force a break -->
+ **Fire III** Healer has to move into the North/East tower safe spot next to the edge. The tether will break and the Healer will share the **Fire III**. Then the Healer will move into the second clockwise tower and soak it.
+ **Fire III** Tank has to move into the South/West tower safe spot at max melee range. The tether will break and the Tank will solo share the **Fire III**, the job cooldown is enough. Then move into the next clockwise safe spot.
<br/><br/><!-- force a break -->
+ Both **Aero III** DPS has to move into the North/East tower safe spot and share with the **Fire III** Healer if possible. Then move into the next clockwise safe spot.
+ Both **Fire III** DPS has to move into the North/East tower safe spot and share with the **Fire III** Healer if possible. Then one of the DPS will rotate into the next clockwise safe spot while the other will go counterclockwise. The tether will break and they will share with the available players.
+ ***The Physical Ranged DPS has to stand into the first North/East tower and soak it regardless of his tether element.***

Here's an example with the first towers on North and South:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="act2-1.jpg;act2-2.jpg;act2-3.jpg" imgDesc="Break the <strong>Dark IV</strong> tether and bait <strong>Dark Design</strong>;<strong>Dark IV</strong> Healer and <strong>Fire III</strong> Tank move South, <strong>Fire III</strong> Healer North and the Physical Ranged in the tower;<strong>Dark IV</strong> Tank and a <strong>Fire III</strong> DPS move to the other group, Healers in towers and <strong>Fire III</strong> DPS on this marks" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Once **Act 2** is done, quickly regroup, heal and mitigate for the incoming **Ultimate Impulse**.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SAkanthaiAct3'></a>

*Hesperos* will immediately follow up with **Akanthai: Act 3** and **Wreath Of Thorns**. Identify where the first set of tower is. The first set will be soaked by Ranged while the second is taken care of by the Melees.  
At the end of the cast, everyone must be inside *Hesperos*' hitbox. While a single melee will move out of it, at max melee range, on the Melees side (East or West) in order to bait **Kothornos Kick**. Then the Ranged will move into their assigned towers. The Melee who baited has to move out of the boss hitbox while the other 3 Melees will move in and spread around the boss to bait **Kothornos Quake**. These player must aim towards the outside in order to not cleave anyone.  
When **Kothornos Quake** and the first **Thunder III** resolve, everyone has to use their knockback immunity. If the boss has been baited properly, the Melees can hit the boss and be inside their towers at the same time.  
Then 3 Ranged will move back to the middle of the arena while the last one will stay next to the edge to bait the next **Kothornos Kick**. At the same time, the second set of **Thunder III** will resolve.  
Once **Kothornos Kick** is done, the Melees can dash to the boss and the baiter can move back middle outside of the boss' hitbox. Let the other 3 Ranged move in and bait the incoming **Kothornos Quakes**.
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="act3-1.jpg;act3-2.jpg;act3-3.jpg;act3-4.jpg" imgDesc="A Melee baits <strong>Kothornos Kick</strong>;Ranged move into the first set of <strong>Thunder III</strong>, the 3 other Melees move in to bait <strong>Kothornos Kick</strong>;Melees move into the second set of <strong>Thunder III</strong>, one Ranged baits <strong>Kothornos Kick</strong>;The 3 other Ranged move in to bait <strong>Kothornos Kick</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When **Act 3** is done, the boss will cast **Nearsight** or **Farsight**, resolve as previously. He will then link up with **Heart Stake**, have both Tanks mitigating this or swap during the cast to have both hit into a Tank invulnerability.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SAkanthaiAct4'></a>

*Hesperos* will cast the next **Akanthai: Act 4** followed by **Searing Stream**. Heal up during **Wreath of Thorns** cast.
Everyone has to wait for the second **Searing Stream** to receive heals, then based on their *Thorn*:

+ **Dark IV** players will move into the next clockwise *Thorn* in order to soak the **Thunder III**.
+ **Water III** players will to the opposite *Thorn* and one *Thorn* clockwise. The tethers will break and won't cleave anyone.
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'act4.jpg' }}'>

Afterward, everyone must regroup South to get healed and break the **Dark IV** tethers sequentially, starting from North in a clockwise manner. Remember to always be away from the *Thorn* that is triggered to avoid the **Fire IV** AoE.

All tethers has to be broken before **Ultimate Impulse** cast reach 60%, heal and mitigate accordingly.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SAkanthaiFinale'></a>

*Hesperos* will continue with **Searing Stream** before casting **Akanthai: Finale**. Once **Wreath of Thorns** is casted, everyone will spread around the *Thorn* they're tethered to, with Melees in contact with the boss and Ranged along the edge or on the sides.
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'finale.jpg' }}'>
*Hesperos* will use **Fleeting Impulse** on everyone and each players must remember the order in which they've been hit.  
Another **Wreath of Thorns** will be casted, showing the order of the **Thunder III** explosions. Each player must stand inside the *Thorn* in the same order as **Fleeting Impulse** hit to get rid of the <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span> in time.

Once **Akanthai** is done, the boss will cast another **Nearsight** or **Farsight**, resolve as previously. Followed by **Searing Stream** into **Demigod Double**, share or use a Tank invulnerability if necessary.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SAkanthaiCurtainCall'></a>

*Hesperos* will use **Akanthai: Curtain Call** to close the fight. Every player will be tethered to a *Thorn* with **Dark IV**.  
The tethers need to be popped in a specific order:

+ Players with the lowest duration will break their tethers first. Reminder that durations are 12, 22, 32 and 42 seconds.
+ A DPS will start first, then it will alternate between a Tank/Healer and DPS.

While the 1st and 5th tethers are breaking, *Hesperos* will cast **Hell's Sting**. Move out of it then move in after the first attack is done to avoid the second set of cones.
