*Hesporos* starts with **Decollation**.

Next is **Bloodrake** on 4 random players (Tanks/Healers or DPS) followed by **Aetheric Chlamys**. Right after is another **Bloodrake** on 4 random players again.

Then *Hesperos* will cast **Director's Belone** and give <span class="speDebuff">Role Call</span> to 4 random players. The players who didn't get hit by the second **Bloodrake** must take them.  
Immediatly follow by **Inversive Chlamys** tethering 4 random players. The players who didn't get hit by the first **Bloodrake** must grab them.  
To do so, the players hit by the second **Bloodrake** will stack behind the boss. When **Director's Belone** cast is over, the two players without a debuff have to ran into the stack to get their <span class="speDebuff">Role Call</span>. Once everyone got a debuff, the players hit by the first **Bloodrake** will stack behind the boss at max melee range. During **Inversive Chlamys** cast, the other players have to move between the boss and the stack to grab the tethers. Once every tethers are taken, the Ranged tethers will move away from the boss East and West while the two Melee tethers will move North of the boss and spread:

Heal everyone before **Decollation**. It's followed by **Elegant Evisceration** on the main target, use the Tank invulnerability here.

*Hesperos* will then cast **Setting the Scene**, as soon as the cast is over, the main Tank can move the boss to a cardinal next to the Lava(fire) tile for uptime.
