+ **<u>Arcane Control</u>:**
Order to the debuff from **High Concept** to resolve dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'> Magic Vulnerability Up</span> debuff:

When pulling, the Tanks must immediately stack together and away from the group to share the auto-attacks alone. *Hephaistos* will do 3 auto-attacks before casting **Aioniopyr**, always mitigate this one for the <span class='debuff'>Bleed</span>.  
The boss will do 2 more auto-attacks before casting **Tyrant's Unholy Darkness**. The Tanks must spread to avoid overlapping and the main Tank can use his invulnerability to absorb the 2 next auto-attacks.

Then *Hephaistos* will cast **Natural Alignment** <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> into **Twist Nature** always displaying the stack and spread gauges. The two players with the debuff must move in front of the boss while the rest of the group will stack in the middle.  
*Hephaistos* will cast **Tyrant's Flare** and once the AoEs are baited, the <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> players move out of it and the rest of the group will either spread around the baited AoEs or stack right of them for the share. Then the boss will cast **Ashing Blaze**, move to the safe safe and either spread or stack to do the second mechanic.  
Then the 4 clones will spawn but only identify the clones of the first two lines. Since the West clones cast **End of Days** first, move on the row where the East clone is. The <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> players must stand in the middle of the row in order to resolve the Fire or Ice gauge:

+ For Fire, form pairs. For each pair, one player player must be on the outer tile to bait the share and the other must be on the inner tile.
+ For Ice, form two groups of three players. On each group, one player player must be on the inner tile to bait the share and the two other must be on the outer tile.

Once the first share happened, switch row and do the other Fire/Ice mechanic. Then quickly regroup middle and mitigate for **Aioniopyr**.

*Hephaistos* will do 2 auto-attacks followed by **Tyrant's Unholy Darkness**, an invulnerability can be used to absorb the next auto-attack.

Now the boss will cast **High Concept**. The players with a short duration on <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span> must move to the North West, North East and South West cardinals respectively. The rest will move to the South East corner, the <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span> with the long <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamme</span> stack around South and the <span class='speDebuff'>Supersplice</span> player stack with the long <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> around the East.
