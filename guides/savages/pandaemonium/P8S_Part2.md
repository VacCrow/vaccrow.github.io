___

+ **<u>Twist Nature</u>:**
Two gauges will appear on top of a player with <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> and later, another two gauges will appear on top of the other player. Each gauge will fill at different speed and its effect will happen once filled, dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span> debuff:

  + Stack/Spread gauge: either put **Forcible Fire III**, a stack on a random player or **Forcible Fire II**, an AoE on every player.

  + Fire/Ice gauge: based on <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> player positions, Fire will target the 3 furthest players with **Forcible Trifire**, a two players share AoE and Ice will target the 2 closest player with **Forcible Difreeze**, a three players share AoE.

  Of course the two players with <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> cannot be targeted by **Twist Nature**.  
  If a player also have the <span class='speDebuff'>Inverse Magicks</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.InverseMagicks }}'> debuff, the gauge mechanics will be reversed.

Then, 4 underground towers named **Orogenic Shift** will spawn. They'll move a bit underground before popping out and dealing earth <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'> Earth Resistance Down II</span> debuff for 9 seconds when soaked. Then a second set of 4 towers will spawn and act the same way.  
If a tower isn't soaked, it deals raid-wide <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applies a <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> debuff.(?)

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<h2><a id='ABHighConcept'>High Concept</a></h2>

+ **<u>High Concept</u>:**
Raid-wide AoE dealing high <span class='magic'>magical damage</span>.

  It may also apply a bunch of debuff among this list:
  + <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.ImperfectionAlpha }}'> lasting 8 and 26 seconds.
  + <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.ImperfectionBeta }}'> lasting 8 and 26 seconds.

  + <span class='speDebuff'>Supersplice</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.Supersplice }}'>, a three-man share lasting 8 seconds.

  The first High Concept cast will randomly apply 1 <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span>, 1 <span class='speDebuff'>Supersplice</span> and 2 of each <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span>. Everyone only has one debuff.

  The second High Concept cast will randomly apply 1 <span class='speDebuff'>Solosplice</span>, 1 <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span> and 2 of each <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span>. Two players will be without debuff and two long <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: X</span> will get a <span class='speDebuff'>Solosplice</span> and a <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span>.

___

+ **<u>Arcane Control</u>:**
Order to the debuff from **High Concept** to resolve dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applying a <span class='debuff'> Magic Vulnerability Up</span> debuff:
  + <span class='speDebuff'>Solosplice</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Supersplice</span> explode in AoE.
  + <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span> explode in a massive AoE and apply the respective <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Alpha</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.PerfectionAlpha }}'>, <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Beta</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.PerfectionBeta }}'>, <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Gamma</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.PerfectionGamma }}'> buff to anyone hit.

  When a player receive a <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: X</span> buff, they are now able to create a concept. Three elements will be shown on top of their head with the main element surrounded by a gold ring.  
  To create a concept, two players must close to each other and will become tethered. After 3 seconds they will create a new concept based on this table:
  <img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'tabConcept.jpg' }}'>

  <span class='speDebuff'>Fiery Conception</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.FieryConception }}'> and <span class='buff'>Winged Conception</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.WingedConception }}'> can be combine to form <span class='buff'>Immortal Spark</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.ImmortalSpark }}'>. When 4 <span class='buff'>Immortal Spark</span> are present, they will automatically combine in <span class='buff'>Immortal Conception</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.ImmortalConception }}'> and kill any player who isn't at full HP. When a player dies with <span class='buff'>Immortal Conception</span>, they come back to life with the <span class='buff'>Everburn</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.Everburn }}'> buff, increasing the damage twofold and without any <span class='debuff'>Weakness</span>.

  <span class='speDebuff'>Fiery Conception</span> is also a hefty DoT. The concepts marked with as "X" aren't used but are also a DoT.  
  If two players with the same concept create a new one, they will wipe the group. (only for wind?)

  When a player receive a new concept, he also get <span class='speDebuff'>Inconceivable</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P8S.Inconceivable }}'> preventing any new concept to be created for 3 seconds.

___

+ **<u>Arcane Channel</u>:**
Multiple tower with a specific element will appear and need to be soaked by a player, being dealt <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and receiving a <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span> debuff. If a player soaks a tower without the correct concept, he will also receive a huge DoT that is lethal.

___

+ **<u>Deconceptualize</u>:**
Remove any Concept from the players.

When pulling, the Tanks must immediately stack together and away from the group to share the auto-attacks alone. *Hephaistos* will do 3 auto-attacks before casting **Aioniopyr**, always mitigate this one for the <span class='debuff'>Bleed</span>.  
The boss will do 2 more auto-attacks before casting **Tyrant's Unholy Darkness**. The Tanks must spread to avoid overlapping and the main Tank can use his invulnerability to absorb the 2 next auto-attacks.

Then *Hephaistos* will cast **Natural Alignment** <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> into **Twist Nature** always displaying the stack/spread gauges. The two players with the debuff must move in front of the boss while the rest of the group will stack in the middle.  
*Hephaistos* will cast **Tyrant's Flare** and once the AoEs are baited, the <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> players move out of it and the rest of the group will either spread around the baited AoEs or stack right of them for the share. Then the boss will cast **Ashing Blaze**, move to the safe safe and either spread or stack to do the second mechanic:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="nature1-1.jpg;nature1-2.jpg;nature1-3.jpg" imgDesc="Stack middle;Dodge the baited AoEs and spread around them (or stack in front for the share);Dodge <strong>Ashing Blaze</strong> and regroup for the share (or spread for the AoEs)" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then the 6 clones will spawn but only identify the clones of the first two rows. Since the West clones cast **End of Days** first, move on the row where the East clone is. The <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> players must stand in the middle of the row in order to resolve the Fire or Ice gauge:

+ For Fire, form pairs. For each pair, one player player must be on the outer tile to bait the share and the other must be on the inner tile.
+ For Ice, form two groups of three players. On each group, one player player must be on the inner tile to bait the share and the two other must be on the outer tile. Two players must

Once the first share happened, switch row and do the other Fire/Ice mechanic:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="nature1-4.jpg;nature1-5.jpg" imgDesc="Move into the safe row and for Fire, each pair bait a share;Move into the safe row and for Ice, each group must bait a share" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then quickly regroup middle and mitigate for **Aioniopyr**. *Hephaistos* will do 2 auto-attacks followed by **Tyrant's Unholy Darkness**, an invulnerability can be used to absorb the next auto-attack.

<a id='SHighConcept1'></a>Now the boss will cast **High Concept**. The players with a short duration on <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span> must move to the North West, North East and South West cardinals respectively. The rest will move to the South East quadrant, the <span class='speDebuff'>Supersplice</span> player stack with the long <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> around the East and the <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span> with the long <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span> stack around South:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'hc1-1.jpg' }}'>

Once **Conceptual Shift** happens, two towers of a random element will appear. The two players that have the tower element as a a secondary element will regroup between the towers and combine into the correct element (<span class='buff'>Winged Conception</span> in this example), then they'll step inside the towers. In the meantime, the rest of group and the remaining <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection</span> debuff will move middle for heals and get ready to stand on the left or right side of the arena for **Ashing Blaze**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="hc1-2.jpg;hc1-3.jpg;hc1-4.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Conceptual Shift</strong> happens;Regroup mid. Alpha and Beta create Wind Conception;Dodge <strong>Ashing Blaze</strong> while Wind Conceptions step in the towers" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then the long duration <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span> must respectively move to the North West, North East and South West cardinals. The remaining <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection</span> debuff can go back to his previous corner to reset his debuff duration if needed.  
Each of the previous <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Supersplice</span> players will move to a Alpha, Beta and Gamma corner. Since we need two of each <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection</span> debuff, they must join a corner to receive a <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection</span>. The must receive the debuffs that were used to create the previous Concept (<span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> in this diagram).  
Lastly, the players with a concept must stand in the South East quadrant with the remaining <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection</span>:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'hc1-5.jpg' }}'>

After the second **Conceptual Shift** hit, four towers of a random element will appear. The 4 players that have the tower element as a secondary element must create this concept to soak the towers. The players with the long duration <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection</span> will move between the North towers and combine while the spare <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection</span> will do the same between the South towers (for <span class='buff'>Aquatic Conception</span> in this example).  
The two remaining <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection</span> players must take care to not create a concept.  
Once the concepts are created, move inside the towers. Then everyone move to the safe half to dodge the second  **Ashing Blaze**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="hc1-6.jpg;hc1-7.jpg;hc1-8.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Conceptual Shift</strong> happens;Long duration Alpha and Gamma create Aquatic Conception North, spare Alpha and Gamma do the same South;Dodge <strong>Ashing Blaze</strong> while Aquatic Conceptions step in the towers" slideNumber=slideCounter %}
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SLimitlessDesolation'></a>

Once **High Concept** is over, the boss will launch 3 auto-attacks.

Then he'll cast **Limitless Desolation**. Split the group in two: Tanks/Healers spread on the left side of the arena between the 1st and the 2nd column, DPS spread of the right side between the 3rd and the 4th column. Example of starting position where the PLD and the SMN are hit first:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'limitless.jpg' }}'>
When a player is hit, he will take the tower on his side that appear at the same time. Move close to your tower and stay between at a tile intersection in order to bait the AoE away from any tower. Don't hesitate to move along the edge to give more space to others.

Once every towers are soaked, *Hephaistos* will cast a new **Aioniopyr** followed by 2 auto-attacks. Next is another **Tyrant's Unholy Darkness** with 2 auto-attacks afterward.

Now *Hephaistos* will cast **Natural Alignment** but this time with one or two <span class='speDebuff'>Inverse Magicks</span> debuffs on <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> players. First it's the stack/spread gauges but this time with the clones casting **End of Days**. Stand on the safe row, either the first or the second one, and move to your assigned tile. If it's spread, have one player on the front of the tile and the other player on the back, otherwise stack together.  
Then it's time for the second gauge Fire/Ice gauge with **End of Days**, resolved the same way as before. Dodge the **Ashing Blaze** when the second gauge is done.  
For stack/spread, follow this pair assignment from left to right: <u>Tanks/Healers w/ <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> - Tanks/Healers - Melee DPS - Ranged DPS</u> or <u>Tanks - Healers - DPS - DPS with <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span></u>. Example with <span class='speDebuff'>Natural Alignment</span> DPS and spread first:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'nature2.jpg' }}'>

After is another **Aioniopyr** with 2 auto-attacks followed by **Tyrant's Unholy Darkness** and a final auto-attack.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SHighConcept2'></a>

*Hephaistos* will cast **High Concept**, remember to mitigate this one. Then the players with a short duration <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Gamma</span> will move to the North West, North East and South West cardinals respectively.  
The two players without anything will join the <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span> player.  
The rest will move to the South East quadrant, the <span class='speDebuff'>Solosplice</span> player stay alone around the East and the <span class='speDebuff'>Multisplice</span> and remaining player stack around South:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'hc2-1.jpg' }}'>

Once **Conceptual Shift** happens, the <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Alpha</span> players who were <u>without</u> debuff previously will combine together.  
The <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Gamma</span> will combine with either the <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Alpha</span> or <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Beta</span> to have the correct concept to soak the towers. It will either be two Water towers or two Lighting towers.  
Once the <span class='buff'>Aquatic Conception</span> or <span class='buff'>Shocking Conception</span> is created, these players have to move in their tower and everyone must dodge the **Ashing Blaze**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="hc2-2.jpg;hc2-3.jpg;hc2-4.jpg;hc2-5.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Conceptual Shift</strong> happens;Gamma combine with Alpha or Beta, both Alpha guests combine together;Regroup mid;Dodge <strong>Ashing Blaze</strong> while Aquatic/Shocking Conceptions step in the towers" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then the long duration <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Alpha</span>, <span class='speDebuff'>Imperfection: Beta</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Imerfection: Gamma</span> must respectively move to the North West, North East and South West cardinals. The leftover <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: X</span> player can join his colleague to refresh his timer.  
The players with a Conception must move to the South East quadrant:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'hc2-6.jpg' }}'>

After **Conceptual Shift** hit, the long duration <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Alpha</span> and <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Beta</span> will move middle and combine together while the <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: Gamma</span> will combine with the <span class='speDebuff'>Perfection: X</span> leftover. Once their Conception is created, they must move inside their towers. It will be 2 Wind towers with 2 Water or Lighting towers, the ones that didn't appear previously.  
The players who were in the South East quadrant will have to move in front of the clones and get tethered to them. The <span class='speDebuff'>Fiery Conception</span> players will take the South and West clones while the <span class='buff'>Aquatic/Shocking Conception</span> players will take care of the North and East ones. Once you're tethered, drag the clones clockwise so they fire on the outside tiles. Remember to be 1 tile away from your clone to not get hit by another one:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="hc2-7.jpg;hc2-8.jpg;hc2-9.jpg;hc2-10.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Conceptual Shift</strong> happens;Long Alpha and Beta combine, long Gamma and leftover combine. Previous Concept player get tethered to clones;Prepare to drag the clones;Conceptions step in the towers while the clones cast <strong>End of Days</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then each <span class='speDebuff'>Fiery Conception</span> players will stack with another <span class='buff'>Winged Conception</span> to create <span class='buff'>Immortal Spark</span>. When four <span class='buff'>Immortal Spark</span> have been created, they will immediately start to merge and create <span class='buff'>Immortal Conception</span> for everyone. <u>It is important for everyone to be full life when <span class='buff'>Immortal Conception</span> is created otherwise it will kill player that said player:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="hc2-11.jpg;hc2-12.jpg" imgDesc="Fiery Conception player move to Winged Conception;Everyone must be full life before receiving Immortal Conception" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

It isn't necessary at all to heal since *Hephaistos* will cast **Ego Death** killing everyone but <span class='buff'>Immortal Conception</span> will revive everyone with the <span class='buff'>Everburn</span> buff.

*Hephaistos* will next cast **Aionagonia**, quickly heal and mitigate for the incoming **Dominion**. Before it hits, everyone must on his own tile on the 1st and 2nd row. Players can occupy a column based on their role: <u>Tanks - Healers - Melee DPS - Ranged DPS</u>.  
The players who got hit by **Orogenic Deformation** will move to the middle while the other 4 will choose a tower and soak it once it's out of the ground. Then the 4 other players will soak the second set of towers.

Next is another **Aionagonia** into **Dominion** resolved the same way as previously. Finally, *Hephaistos* will cast a new **Ego Death**, the real enrage this time.
