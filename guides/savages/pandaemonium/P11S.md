<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase1'></a>

*Themis* starts with **Eunomia** followed by **Dike** where both Tanks must have enmity, use Tank invulnerability or mitigate.

Then the boss will cast **Jury Overruling**. Spread around the boss at max melee range and once you're hit by the line AoEs, move inside the boss to do the 4-man shares in *Themis* use the <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span> otherwise, after getting hit, the Tanks and Healers will move to their respective partner to do the 2-man shares if the <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span> element is used.

**Upheld Overruling** is casted next. The player with the tether can stand right under *Themis* 's spear so he won't move during the attack.  
If it's <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span>, have everyone middle to soak the jump attack, then move in groups and away from the boss to do the 4-man shares. For <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span> element, only the tethered Tank must be middle while the rest is away, once the jump happens, move inside the boss in pairs for the 2-man shares.

*Themis* will turn and cast **Divisive Overruling**, remember to stay out of the initial dash. If it's <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span>, you can move out at max melee range in groups to dodge both attack and do the share. It it's <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span>, dodge the initial dash then move inside in pairs to do the 2-man share and dodge the second hit.

Quickly heal an regroup middle for **Styx**.

*Themis* will cast **Arcane Revelation**. Quickly note the element he's using and move into the safe spot of your side (there's two safe spots opposite from each other), in front of the portals he's not imbued with.  
Then he will follow up with **Dismissal Overruling**. Use your knockback immunity when the cast starts, then based on the element:

+ Stay at max melee ranage for <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span> in order to dodge everything and soak the 4-man shares.
+ if it's <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span>, wait for the portals' **Arche** before moving inside in pairs and soak.

Right after, the boss will cast **Shadowed Messagers**. Quickly check their elements and get ready to dodge both of them at the same time since they attack simultaneously. So can preposition in groups on East and West for easyness.  
In the meantime, *Themis* will cast his own **Divisive Overruling** so be aware of his element.  
First dodge the clones **Divisive Ruling** initial attacks, then move to dodge the second part of the <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span> **Divisive Ruling** attack. If you're at max melee rage you will dodge the <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span> **Divisive Ruling** second hit and the *Themis* initial dash. Then dodge the second part of *Themis* dash. Remember to move inside or outside the boss and soak the shares.  
Then everyone will regroup middle for the <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span> share while the Tank with the other tether will stay at max melee range to not overlap them. Once both are done, quickly move outside where the <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span> **Upheld Ruling** took place.
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="shadowMsg1.jpg;shadowMsg2.jpg;shadowMsg3.jpg;shadowMsg4.jpg;shadowMsg5.jpg" imgDesc="Dodge the initial dashes;Dodge the second hit at max melee range;Move inside and do pairs (or outside and groups);Everyone middle but the Tank with the tether;Move where the tethered Tank is" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Themis* will reappear middle and cast **Jury Overruling**, resolve as previously but used boss' relative positions. It is followed by another **Styx**, be sure to heal everyone since this one has one more hit.

Next is **Lightstream**. In order to quickly find the safe spot, while looking at the boss, put a counter-clockwise portal (blue arrows) to your left and a clockwise portal (orange arrows) to your right. Then look at the opposite portal to know if you have to side step to the left or the right.  
While the lasers are rotating, *Themis* will cast **Divisive Overruling**. Check the element and get into position while you're dodging **Lightstream**.

Afterward, he will cast **Eunomia** followed by **Upheld Overruling**, resolve as before.

*Themis* will now cast **Dark and Light** applying <span class='speDebuff'>Discord</span> debuffs to everyone. Based on your role and type of tether (long or short), take these positions:

+ Tank with short tether => North
+ Tank with long tether => East
+ Healer with short tether => South
+ Healer with long tether => West
+ DPS with short tether move next to their partner on intercardinal
+ DPS with long tether move to the opposite side on intercardinal

<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'darkAndLightPos.jpg' }}'>

Orbs will be summoned with **Arcane Revelation**. Check the boss element and move next to the orbs on the opposite side. If you have to move, move counter-clockwise with your partner.  
Once the orbs exploded, move back to your previous position and get ready for **Jury Overruling** and if it's :

+ <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span>: once the AoEs are baited, move at max melee range on North West and South East to do the group shares.
+ <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span>: once the AoEs are baited, the Tank and Healer with long tether move counter-clockwise to pair with the DPS next to them and the short tethers move together counter-clockwise inside the East and West donuts AoEs.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="dnlGlare1.jpg;dnlGlare2.jpg;dnlGloom1.jpg;dnlGloom2.jpg" imgDesc="Previsualisation of baited AoEs for <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span>;Regroup on North West and South East;Previsualisation of baited AoEs for <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span>;Long tether Tank/Healer counter-clockwise with next DPS, short tether East and West" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Move back to your position to get ready for **Divisive Overruling**. Dodge the initial dash then do pairs or groups based on the element. Here's an example for <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span>:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'dnlDiv.jpg' }}'>

> For <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span>, split in left/right groups using the diagram above.

Keep your distances until **Emissary's Will** is casted and removes the tethers.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase2'></a>

*Themis* will cast another **Styx** with 7 hits followed by **Dike**.

Afterward, split in groups for **Dark Current** and check the AoEs direction. Then on each group, have the melees next to the boss and the ranged out to not overlap **Blinding Light** and follow the AoEs that rotate.  
Quickly heal and get ready the next set of mechanics: **Jury Overruling**, **Upheld Overruling** and **Divisive Overruling**. There's a few seconds between each mechanic.

*Themis* will give a bit of respite while casting another **Eunomia**.

> For the whole **Letter of the Law** mechanics, use absolute positions since the boss will keep turning around.

Next he will cast **Letter of the Law**, Healers and DPS can already move to the East while the Tanks can stay middleand wait.  
Then the boss will cast **Twofold Revelation**, check the element, move into the safe spots then move under the orb with the opposite element. You can use the lines on the ground to safely dodge the portals' **Arche**.  
Meanwhile, the Tank with the <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span> tether will move to the West safe spot while the other Tank will rejoin the group in the East safe spot.  

Example with the boss imbue with <span style='color:goldenrod'><strong>Holy</strong></span>:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'letterPos.jpg' }}'>

When every **Twofold Revelation** AoEs resolve, the Tank with the <span style='color:darkorchid'><strong>Dark</strong></span> tether can move a bit middle to bring the jump closer from the rest of the group.
Once the clones jump, quickly move into the safe spot then move in usual pairs into the **Heart of Judgement** towers to soak them.  
After the towers are soaked, quickly make groups on East and West to dodge the initial **Divisive Ruling** dashes then move into the safe spots for the second dashes. While moving, check the boss to know the element of **Dismissal Overruling** (use your knockback immunity when you dodge the first dash). As soon as you dodge the second dashes, move inside in pairs or outside in groups according to the boss' element.

Then *Themis* will continue with another **Styx**.

Next is **Lightstream** combined into **Divisive Overruling**.

Finally the boss will use **Dike** followed by **Jury Overruling** and **Eunomia** before cast his enrage **Ultimate Verdict**.
