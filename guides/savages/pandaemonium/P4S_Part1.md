*Hesporos* starts with **Decollation**.

Next is **Bloodrake** on 4 random players (Tanks/Healers or DPS) followed by **Aetheric Chlamys**. Right after there is another **Bloodrake** on 4 random players again.

The players hit by the second **Bloodrake** will stack behind *Hesperos*. Then he will cast **Director's Belone** and assign <span class="speDebuff">Role Call</span> to 4 players. The debuffs will spread immediatly among the player in the stack. The two players left without a debuff have to ran into the stack, one at a time, to get their <span class="speDebuff">Role Call</span>.  
Once everyone got a debuff, the players hit by the first **Bloodrake** will stack behind the boss at max melee range while he start casting **Inversive Chlamys**. During the cast, the other players have to move between the boss and the stack to grab the tethers. Once every tethers are taken, the Ranged tethers will move away from the boss East and West while the two Melee tethers will move North of the boss and spread:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="bd1-1.jpg;bd1-2.jpg;bd1-3.jpg;bd1-4.jpg;bd1-5.jpg" imgDesc="Second <strong>Bloodrake</strong> players stack South;<strong>Role Call</strong> debuffs are assigned;The two players without <strong>Role Call</strong> ran into the stack to get them;First <strong>Bloodrake</strong> players stack South outside the boss, the others inside;The players inside grab the tethers and fan out on the North side" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Heal everyone before **Decollation**. It's followed by **Elegant Evisceration** on the main target, use the Tank invulnerability here.

*Hesperos* will then cast **Setting the Scene**, as soon as the cast is over the main Tank can move the boss to a cardinal next to the Lava(fire) tile for uptime.
Right after, the boss will cast **Pinax** activating the tiles:

+ If the first tile is **(Lightning)**, move to the edge where the boss is, inside the **(Fire)** tile:  
	+ if **(Fire)** is second, form two light groups, one along the edge, the other close to the middle.  
	+ if **(Poison)** is second, spread out in the arena, Melees around the boss and ranged anywhere else in the arena.  
+ If the first tile is **(Water)**, move to the edge where the boss is, inside the **(Fire)** tile. Or you can use your knockback immunity to prepare for the second tile positions:  
	+ if **(Fire)** is second, form two light groups, one along the edge, the other close to the middle.  
	+ if **(Poison)** is second, spread out in the arena, Melees areound the boss and ranged anywhere else in the arena.

After the 2nd **Mekhane** *Hesperos* will move back to the middle and cast **Northernly/Easternly/Southernly/Westernly Shift**, check where he's jumping and if he'll use his sword or cape. After the third tile activated, he will jump and perform his attack, either stand on *Hesperos* sides for the sword **Swift** or in front of him for the cape **Swift**.  
There's 10 seconds between the third and fourth tile to do the **Swift** mechanic and get into positions for the fourth tile.

+ If the third tile is **(Lightning)**, move to the edge where *Hesperos* is jumping to:  
	+ if **(Fire)** is fourth, form two light groups, one along the edge, the other close to the middle.  
	+ if **(Poison)** is fourth, spread out in the arena, Melees around the boss and ranged anywhere else in the arena. The boss can be move middle as soon as **Swift** is over to create more space for Melees.  
+ If the third tile is **(Water)**, stand middle and aim to get knocked where *Hesperos* is jumping to. Or you can use your knockback immunity to prepare for the fourth tile positions and avoid, at the same time, the possible knockback from **Swift**:  
	+ if **(Fire)** is fourth, form two light groups, one along the edge, the other close to the middle.  
	+ if **(Poison)** is fourth, spread out in the arena, Melees around the boss and ranged anywhere else in the arena. The boss can be move middle as soon as **Swift** is over to create more space for Melees.

*Hesperos* wil continue with **Elegant Evisceration**, remember to swap before if you use the other Tank invulnerability.

Then he will use **Bloodrake** on everyone + 3 tiles, remember the element of the tile that wasn't tethered for later.

The tiles will come back with **Setting the Scene**, then he will use **Vengeful Belone** to assign an <span class="speDebuff">Acting Role</span> to everyone. Next is **Elemental Belone**, giving you the <span class="speDebuff">Elemental Resistance Down</span> debuff based on the previous **Bloodrake**.

*Hesperos* will use **Bloodrake** as a raid-wide and will follow up with **Belone Bursts**.  
Before **Belone Bursts** cast is over, take the following positions in pairs:
+ Tanks on North and North West cardinal.
+ Healers on North East and East cardinal.
+ DPS with <span class="speDebuff">Acting Tank</span> on South East and South, opposite of Tanks.
+ DPS with <span class="speDebuff">Acting Healer</span> fanned out from South West and West, opposite of Healers.

When the orbs appear, each pairs will run to the opposite side and pop the 2 orbs, the intercardinal one first then the cardinal one. Remember to mitigate and wait between the two orbs to recieve some healing:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="burst1.jpg;burst2.jpg;burst3.jpg;burst4.jpg;burst5.jpg" imgDesc="Spread around the boss based on your debuff;Orbs spawn;Move to the opposite intercardinal side with your pair;Soak the first orb;Wait a bit for heals and soak the second orb" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Quickly take out the orbs before he start casting **Periaktoi** then stand into the tile that wasn't tethered previously.
