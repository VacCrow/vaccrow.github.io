The fight starts with **Hemitheos's Dark IV**, these raid-wides need to be mitigated. It is followed by **Chelic Synergy**, either have both Tanks sharing this or use a Tank invulnerability.

Next is **Aetheric Polyominoid** with 2 "+" tiles, leaving the 2 inner tiles east or west safe. Form two light groups around your Healers for **Unholy Darkness** and stand out of **Exocleaver** cones. Once the share is done, move into the previous cones to dodge the seconds ones.

*Hegemone* will then cast **Pathogenic Cells** numbering players from 1 to 8. Odd number will be on the West side while the even numbers wil be on the East side. The number 1 must stand on the North West diagonal and the number 2 on the north east diagonal, the rest of the players can wait South. Once an odd player is cleaved on your side, the next odd number must replace him. Do the same on the even side:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'patho.jpg' }}'>

Next, **Aetherial Exchange** is casted followed by **Exchange of Agonies** with 2 swap tethers. After the swap, the 4 **Darkbursts** will either be on every DPS or every Tanks and Healers while the four others get the 3 **Dark Perimeter** and the **Unholy Darkness**. The players with **Darkburst** has to move to their assigned intercardinal far away from the boss while the rest has to stack middle.  
While everyone is positionning themselves, *Hegemone* will cast **Choros Ixou** so remember to dodge both cleaves at the same time.
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="agonies1-1.jpg;agonies1-2.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Darkburst</strong> outside at intercardinal, the others in. Dodge <strong>Chorus Ixou</strong>;Dodge the second part of <strong>Chorus Ixou</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then, *Hegemone* will cast **Synergy**, either swap Tanks or have the main Tank use his invulnerability so counter the <span class='debuff'> Magic Vulnerability Up</span> debuff. It is followed by another **Hemitheos's Dark IV**.

Quickly after, **Transmission** is casted placing debuffs on players before casting **Choros Ixou**. When they resolve, the players with <span class='speDebuff'>Chelomorph</span> must look towards the boss and the players with <span class='speDebuff'>Glossomorph</span> must look away from the boss. Furthemore they should be in the safe spot of **Choros Ixou** ready to dodge its second part:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="transm1.jpg;transm2.jpg" imgDesc="Move next to <strong>Chorus Ixou</strong>, snakes looking out and wings looking in;Dodge the second part of <strong>Chorus Ixou</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Next is another **Aetherial Exchange** with **Polyominoid Sigma** soon followed by **Dark Dome**. Have everyone stack middle to bait **Dark Dome** then move away from the boss in the corner of the safe tile. The safe tile is always 2 tiles away from the tile that isn't in a corner of the arena:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="polyo1-1.jpg;polyo1-2.jpg" imgDesc="Stack mid for <strong>Dark Dome</strong>;Move in the corner of the safe tile" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Hegemone* wil cast **Aetherial Exchange** with **Exchange of Agonies**, composed of 2 **Darkburst** and 2 **Unholy Darkness** that will be swapped. The players who will have the **Darkburst** after the swap must move away from the boss at North East and South West while the remaining Tanks and Healers will stack in the inner South East tile and the DPS in the inner North West tile. Remember to dodge the two parts of **Exocleaver** before and after the AoEs happen.

This time it will be **Chelic Synergy** or **Synergy** randomly into **Hemitheos's Dark IV**. Resolve as previously.

Once again, another **Aetherial Exchange** and **Polyominoid Sigma** with an **Unholy Darkness** on both Healers. There's two safe tiles, one for each group.

Then everyone must move to their assigned intercardinal, with melees in and ranged out for **Dark Ashes** with **Choros Ixou**. Dodge the second part of **Choros Ixou** after the AoEs are done.

**Cachexia** will give debuffs to everyone, players with <span class='speDebuff'>Chelic Resistance Down</span> will move to the right side of the boss and players with <span class='speDebuff'>Glossal Resistance Down</span> to her left. Stay outside of the boss' hitbox, at max melee range, and spread to avoid killing other with your <span class='speDebuff'>Aetheronecrosis</span>.  
Then, on each side everyone has to get hit once by **Dual Predation**. In order to not die from the <span class='debuff'>Physical Vulnerability Up</span> applied by <span class='speDebuff'>Aetheronecrosis</span>, each player need to take a hit based on their <span class='speDebuff'>Aetheronecrosis</span> initial timer.  
Move inside the hitbox when it's your turn based on this order: <u>20s > 8s > 12s > 16s</u>.  
Once everyone got hit by **Dual Predation**, swap side to survive the incomming **Ptera Ixou**.

A random **Chelic Synergy** or **Synergy** in comming with a **Hemitheos's Dark IV**.

Next is **Aetheric Polyominoid** with 2 "X" shape tiles placed middle and veryone has to deal with **Dark Sphere**. The Tanks can take the inner North tile and the Melee DPS the South inner one and stand on opposite corner to be safe. Each Ranged can move to his own intercardinal where he'll have one or two safe tiles, while being away from the players middle.  
After the AoE resolve, move away from where you were to dodge **Dark Dome**:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'darkdark.jpg' }}'>

The first **Exchange of Agonies** is back with **Aetherial Exchange** and **Choros Ixou** that must resolved in the same way.

*Hegemone* will continue with **Aetherial Exchange** and **Polyominoid Sigma**, 2 "+" and 1 "X" tiles along a single diagonal, combined with **Choros Ixou**. There's two safe spots, one on the front/back of the boss, the second on her side. They are at the intersection of the "X" tile (after the swap) and the empty tile in the diagonal.  
Move into the appropriate spot to dodge **Choros Ixou** and move to avoid the second part.  
Example of safe spots:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'polyo2.jpg' }}'>

Another random **Chelic Synergy** or **Synergy** with **Hemitheos's Dark IV**.

**Cachexia** oOOoOOOOOOOoooOoo
