*Erichtonios* will start the fight with **Heavy Hand**.

Soon after, he will use **Aetherial Shackles** immadiatly followed by **Warder's Wrath**, so don't forget to stay mid for a second to recieve some heals.  
Have everyone spread around the boss, melees in on cardinals and ranged slightly out on intercardinals.  
If a ranged player have <span class="speDebuff">Shackles of Companionship</span>, that player must swap position with the one who has <span class="speDebuff">Shackles of Loneliness</span>. Otherwise, everyone assumes these positions:


Next is **Gaoler's Flail**, with either the combo morningstar/chakram or double anchor.  
Follow by **Pitiless Flail of Grace** or **Pitiless Flail of Purgation** at random. Swap tank during the cast and have the new tank share or move away depending of the cast name. For the flare, the tank can stand at max melee range at North East while the rest of the rest of the group stays South to keep uptime.
