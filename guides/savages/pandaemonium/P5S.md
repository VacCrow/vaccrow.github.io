<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>

The fight starts with **Sonic Howl**.

Followed by **Ruby Glow**, remember to mitigate these. The arena will be divided in 4, with 2 *Topaz Stones* and 2 *Poison Stones*. Either move into the quadrant without any *Stones* to have a mostly free quadrant or move to the one with the *Poison Stone* very close to the middle, leaving the corner as a safe spot.

Before the poison pools dissapear, *Proto-Carbuncle* will cast **Venomous Mass**. The main Tank has to cross through the boss to take the hit alone and swap Tanks during the cast. The new main Tank will receive **Toxic Crunch**. Take care of the second Tank since the damage from the <span class='debuff'>Poison</span> and the auto-attacks can be nasty.

> The whole tankbuster cannot be cheesed with invulnerability because the <span class='debuff'>Physical Vulnerability Up</span> debuff from **Venomous Mass** along with the <span class='debuff'>Poison</span> from **Toxic Crunch** will be lethal to anyone since the <span class='debuff'>Poison</span> duration is longer than any invulnerabilities.

Then the **Caustic Pools** will appear. Each one of these will be soaked by player of the same role. The Tanks and Melee DPS will soak the inner ones while the Healers and Ranged DPS will soak the outter ones.  
You can enter inside when there's 2-3 ticks left to avoid unnecessary damage from <span class='debuff'>Toxicosys</span>.

Another **Venomous Mass** and **Toxic Crunch** combo, swap Tanks as previously.

*Proto-Carbuncle* will cast the second **Ruby Glow** dividing the arena in 2. Along the wall, 1 *Topaz Stone* and 1 *Poison Stone* will spawn. Then the boss will move middle and cast **Double Rush**. Move behind him and use your knockback immunity during the cast. After the first dash, switch side if you're on the side with the *Topaz Stone*. Remember to have some kind of mitigation to survive the second dash.

Another **Sonic Howl** is casted before the next **Ruby Glow**, dividing the arena in 4. Multiple sets of *Topaz Stones* will fall:

+ First set: 2 *Stones* on opposite quadrants.
+ Second set: 2 *Stones* on the two other quadrants.
+ Third set: 3 *Stones* on different quadrants, leaving one safe spot.
+ Fourth set: 3 *Stones* on different quadrants with the safe spot being on the opposite side of the previous one.

To solve this mechanic: move into a safe spot from the first set, then move into an adjacent quadrant. Then move in the only safe spot from the third set and finally move to the opposite quadrant.

Next is once again a **Venomous Mass** into **Toxic Crunch** combo, swap Tanks as usual.

Then the boss will cast either **Venom Squall** or **Venom Surge**. For **Venom Squall**, spread around the boss to get your AoEs, move insde the boss to bait the ground AoEs then form two groups with your Healers for the shares. Do this in reversed order for **Venom Surge**.

Once it's over, the boss will cast **Claw to Tail** or **Tail to Claw** telling which side he'll cleave first. Beware of the **Raging Claw** part since he attacks 7 times.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase2'></a>

*Proto-Carbuncle* will then jump back middle and prepare for **Starving Stampede**. Watch out for the *Red Jaw* marker and stand on the opposite quandrant of the second jump. When *Proto-Carbuncle* starts to jump, you have to swap to the opposite quadrant every 2 jumps. This works with any **Starving Stampede** pattern.

While he's jumping, **Caustic Pools** will spawn on cardinals and had to be soaked right when the jumps are over. Healers will soak the East pool, Melee DPS the South one and Ranged DPS the West one.  
The North has be be unsoaked in order to spwan a *Lively Bait* and reset the boss gauge. A Tank must stand next to the pool and use his invulnerability to absorb the damage from **Venom**, since the soak is failed (Also you can have a Tank inside and the second right outside the pool to share the damage of **Venom**).

Next is another **Sonic Howl** into **Ruby Glow** dividing the arena in 2. 3 *Topaz Stones* will spawn on one side the wall and 2 *Topaz Stones* on the other side.  
The two Healers will be targeted by the share **Venom Pool** and if the share hits a *Topaz Stone*, it will transform into a *Poison Stone*. Everyone has to move to the side with 2 *Topaz Stones* and each groups have to do their share next to a *Topaz Stone* so this side of the arena becomes safe. The Healers can stand inside the *Topaz Stone* AoE to be sure to hit it. Remember to move away from the poison afterwards.

*Proto-Carbuncle* will perform another set of **Venomous Mass** and **Toxic Crunch**, swap Tanks again.

It's time for the next **Ruby Glow**, dividing the arena in 4. There will be 2 *Topaz Stones* on opposite quadrants and 2 *Poison Stones* on the other quadrants. Move in light groups into the quandrant with the *Poison Stones*.  
The boss will start to cast **Venom Squall** and when the cast is over the *Topaz Stones* will explode creating more space. Have everyone spread out to not overlap the AoEs, Tanks in between the poison pools, Melee DPS at max melee range and Ranged outside. After, regroup at max melee ranged to bait the AoEs, then move in to do the share group with the Healers (The poison pools disappear when the baited AoEs explode and you have 3 seconds to readjust for the shares if needed).
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="ruby1.jpg;ruby2.jpg;ruby3.jpg;ruby4.jpg;ruby5.jpg" imgDesc="Move in group into the safe quadrant and wait for the <em>Topaz Stones</em> explosions;Spread for <strong>Venom Drop</strong>. Tanks in, Melee DPS at max range and Ranged outside;Regroup at max melee range for <strong>Venom Drop</strong>;Move in to dodge the ground AoEs;Share with the Healers" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

A new set of **Caustic Pools** will spawn when the **Venom Pools** happen. Resolve it the same way as the first one.

Then he will cast **Claw to Tail** or **Tail to Claw** followed by the **Venomous Mass**/**Toxic Crunch** combo.

Next *Proto-Carbuncle* will do a **Sonic Howl** into **Ruby Glow**. i don't know about this one yet.  
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Here is another **Venomous Mass** into **Toxic Crunch** with a Tank swap.

Next is **Sonic Howl** followed by either **Venom Squall** or **Venom Surge**.

Right after is a random **Claw to Tail** or **Tail to Claw** into **Venomous Mass**/**Toxic Crunch**.

Finally *Proto-Carbuncle* will begin his enrage with **Sonic Shatter** and close the fight with **Acidic Slaver**.
