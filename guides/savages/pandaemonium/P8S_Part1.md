<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>

The fight starts with **Genesis of Flame** immediately follwed by **Conceptual Tetraflare/Octoflare**.

The boss will then cast **Volcanic Torches**. Move into your assigned quadrant and check the flame lines for your four tiles. The corner tile is always unsafe then:

+ If one of the two outter tiles doesn't have a flame line along the edge, this tile is safe.
+ If both outter tiles have a flame line along the edge, the inner tile is safe.

While you're trying to find your safe tile, *Hephaistos* will cast **Sunforge** cleaving either his side or his front/back. Once you're into your safe tile, either spread or stack with your partner for **Conceptual** and dodge **Sunforge**.

Then *Hephaistos* will cast **Flameviper**, each Tank must swap after each hit.

*Hephaistos* will now cast **Reforged Reflection** switching into *Gorgon* or *Hippo* mode. If it's the former, move away from the boss. For the latter, either stand middle and get knocked away to the corner or use your knockback immunity.

<a id='S1stTransformation'></a>

If *Hephaistos* switch into *Gorgon* mode, he'll start with **Gorgomanteia** placing debuffs on everyone.  
Form two lights groups, the first one will deal with the first mechanic they find starting from the North West incardinal and searching counter-clockwise while the second group will start North and search clockwise. If within one group, both the Tank and the Healer got the same debuff, the Tanks will swap groups and if the two DPS got the same debuff, the two Ranged will swap group.

In the meantime, the first set of *Gorgons* will spawn, when they get close to an (inter)cardinal, look away from them to dodge **Petrification**.  
Then the <span class='speDebuff'>First in Line</span> players will act. On each group the player with <span class='speDebuff'>Eye of the Gorgon</span> must look at the *Gorgon* to petrify it then the <span class='speDebuff'>Blood of the Gorgon</span> player will move next to it to kill it with the debuff.  
Soon after the second set of *Gorgons* spawn, remember to look away when they dig out. Then the <span class='speDebuff'>Second in Line </span> players will do the same thing to kill the remaining *Gorgons*.

Quickly heal everyone for the last attack, **Ektothermos**.

___

If *Hephaistos* switch into *Gorgon* mode, he'll start with **Rearing Rampage** and **Uplift**.  
Have everyone spread around the boss hitbox with the Tanks North and South and the Healers inside the hitbox so they can heal everyone during **Rearing Rampage**. Everyone will get hit by **Uplift** and must remember if they took the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th hit.  
Then the boss will cast **Stomp Dead**, the first pair must move at the North West intercardinal and the second must move middle. The 3rd and 4th will stay at the East cardinal. Then the boss will jump on each pair sequentially. When the 1st pair is hit, they swap their position with the 3rd pair and the 2nd pair will do the same with the 4th one.

___

*Hephaistos* will the revert to his original form and cast **Illusory Creation** followed by **Creation on Command**. Each pair has to move to his assigned quadrant.  
The first **Command** will always be a **Sun's Pinion** (Phoinix) with a **Scorching Fang** (Dragon) leaving two possible safe spots, either the two tiles North/South or East/West. Spread in the safe spot to avoid cliping other players with **Manifold Flames** AoEs, then the 4 players who didn't get hit will move inside the boss hitbox on intercardinals to bait the second part of **Manifold Flames**.
Then move in the inner or in the corner tiles to dodge the second **Command** and either spread for **Nest of Flamevipers** or group in pairs for **Tetraflares**.

Dodge the **Volcanic Torches** with one safe spot on a corner and mitigite the incoming **General of Flame**
