The fight starts with **Genesis of Flame** immediately follwed by **Conceptual Tetraflare/Octoflare**.

The boss will then cast **Volcanic Torches**. Move into your assigned quadrant and check the flame lines for your four tiles. The corner tile is always unsafe then:

+ If one of the two outter tiles doesn't have a flame line along the edge, this tile is safe.
+ If both outter tiles have a flame line along the edge, the inner tile is safe.

While you're trying to find your safe tile, *Hephaistos* will cast **Sunforge** cleaving either his side or his front/back. Once you're into your safe tile, either spread or stack with your partner for **Conceptual** and dodge **Sunforge**.

Then *Hephaistos* will cast **Flameviper**, each Tank must swap after each hit.
