<h1><a id='Strategy'>Strategy</a></h1>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>

The fight starts with **Genesis of Flame** immediately followed by **Conceptual Tetraflare/Octoflare**.

The boss will then cast **Volcanic Torches**. Move into your assigned quadrant and check the flame lines for your four tiles. The corner tile is always unsafe then:

+ If one of the two outer tiles doesn't have a flame line along the edge, this tile is safe.
+ If both outer tiles have a flame line along the edge, the inner tile is safe.

While you're trying to find your safe tile, *Hephaistos* will cast **Sunforge** cleaving either his side or his front/back. Once you're into your safe tile, either spread or stack with your partner for **Conceptual** and dodge **Sunforge**.

Then *Hephaistos* will cast **Flameviper**, each Tank must swap after each hit.

*Hephaistos* will now cast **Reforged Reflection** switching into *Gorgon* or *Hippo* mode. If it's the former, move away from the boss. For the latter, either stand middle and get knocked away to the corner or use your knockback immunity.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='S1stTransformations'></a>

If *Hephaistos* switch to *Gorgon* mode, he'll start with **Gorgomanteia** placing debuffs on everyone.  
Form two lights groups, the first one will deal with the first mechanic they find starting from the North West incardinal and searching counter-clockwise while the second group will start North and search clockwise. If within one group, both the Tank and the Healer get the same debuff, the Tanks will swap groups and if the two DPS get the same debuff, the two Ranged will swap group.

In the meantime, the first set of *Gorgons* will spawn, when they get close to an (inter)cardinal, look away from them to dodge **Petrification**.  
Then the <span class='speDebuff'>First in Line</span> players will act. In each group the player with <span class='speDebuff'>Eye of the Gorgon</span> must look at the *Gorgon* to petrify it then the <span class='speDebuff'>Blood of the Gorgon</span> player will move next to it to kill it with the debuff.  
Soon after the second set of *Gorgons* spawn, remember to look away when they dig out. Then the <span class='speDebuff'>Second in Line </span> players will do the same thing to kill the remaining *Gorgons*.

Quickly heal everyone for the last attack, **Ektothermos**.

___

If *Hephaistos* switch to *Hippo* mode, he'll start with **Rearing Rampage** and **Uplift**.  
Have everyone spread around the boss hitbox with the Tanks North and South and the Healers inside the hitbox so they can heal everyone during **Rearing Rampage**. Everyone will get hit by **Uplift** and must remember if they took the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th hit.  
Then the boss will cast **Stomp Dead**, the first pair must move to the North West intercardinal and the second must move middle. The 3rd and 4th will stay at the East cardinal. Then the boss will jump on each pair sequentially. When the 1st pair is hit, they swap their position with the 3rd pair and the 2nd pair will do the same with the 4th one:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="rampage1.jpg;rampage2.jpg" imgDesc="Spread for <strong>Rearing Rampage</strong>;Positions for <strong>Stomp Dead</strong>, pair n°1 swap with pair n°3 and pair n°2 swap with pair n°4" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

___

*Hephaistos* will then revert to his original form and cast **Illusory Creation** followed by **Creation on Command**. Each pair has to move to his assigned quadrant.  
The first **Command** will always be a **Sun's Pinion** (Phoinix) with a **Scorching Fang** (Dragon) leaving two possible safe spots, either the two tiles North/South or East/West. Spread in the safe spot to avoid cliping other players with **Manifold Flames** AoEs, then the 4 players who didn't get hit will move inside the boss hitbox on intercardinals to bait the second part of **Manifold Flames**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="command1.jpg;command2.jpg" imgDesc="Move to the safe spot in your quadrant and spread;Players who didn't get <strong>Manifold Flames</strong> move inside the boss intercardinals for <strong>Nest of Flamevipers</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then move in the inner or in the corner tiles to dodge the second **Command** and either spread for **Nest of Flamevipers** or group in pairs for **Tetraflares**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="command3DDNest.jpg;command3DDTetra.jpg;command3PPNest.jpg;command3PPTetra.jpg" imgDesc="Double <em>Dragons</em> with <strong>Nest of Flamevipers</strong>;Double <em>Dragons</em> with <strong>Tetraflares</strong>;Double <em>Phoinix</em> with <strong>Nest of Flamevipers</strong>;Double <em>Phoinix</em> with <strong>Tetraflares</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Dodge the **Volcanic Torches** with one safe spot on a corner and mitigite the incoming **General of Flame**. To easily find the safe spot, watch and follow the fire lines when they appear. They will converge on one corner and when they reach it they will move towards another corner, the corner opposite of that one is the safe spot.

Then *Hephaistos* will use **Reforged Reflection** and switch to *Gorgon* or *Hippo*, the one he didn't use before.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SFourfoldFires'></a>

Once the second **Reforged Reflection** is completed, *Hephaistos* will swap back to his usual form and cast **Conceptual Octaflare/Tetraflare**, remember which one it is.

Then the boss will cast **Fourfold Fires**, regroup middle and mitigate through it. Afterward the boss will cast **Cthonis Vents** activating the fire puddles so move away from them. Then the *Dragons* will jump out and dive into another set of puddles and the boss will cast **Octoflares** or **Tetraflare**.  
Dodge the second explosion from **Cthonis Vents** in light parties, then either spread or stack in pairs. If you end up with **Tetraflare**, on each side make a pair with the Tank and one Melee DPS and the pair with the Healer and the Ranged DPS:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="fourfold1.jpg;fourfold2Octa.jpg;fourfold2Tetra.jpg" imgDesc="Dodge the first <strong>Fourfold Fires</strong>;Dodge the second <strong>Fourfold Fires</strong> and spread for <strong>Octaflare</strong>;Dodge the second <strong>Fourfold Fires</strong> and make pairs for <strong>Tetraflare</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

The *Dragons* will jump again, move in light parties to dodge them and while the third **Cthonis Vents** happens, check *Hephaistos* to know which **Sunforge** he's casting. Then move in or out based on this cast and at the same time, spread or make pairs to resolve the **Conceptual Octaflare/Tetraflare** cast at the beginning:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="fourfold3.jpg;fourfold4DOcta.jpg;fourfold4PTetra.jpg" imgDesc="Dodge the third <strong>Fourfold Fires</strong>;Example of <em>Phoinix</em> <strong>Sunforge</strong> with <strong>Tetraflare</strong>;Example of <em>Dragon</em> <strong>Sunforge</strong> with <strong>Octaflare</strong>" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

To end this part, *Hephaistos* will cast another **Flameviper** requirering a double swap.

</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='S2ndTransformations'></a>

Soon after, *Hephaistos* will transform again into the first form he took then he will perform another **Flameviper** before switching into the second form.

___

If *Hephaistos* starts with *Gorgon* mode, he'll do a **Snaking Kick** so move outsite his hitbox then he'll cast **Gorgomanteia** applying debuffs. He'll continue with **Into the Shadows** and 4 *Gorgons* will spawn at the same time. Everyone has to move into their inner tile quadrant since clones of *Hephaistos* will cast **Gorgospit** on the outer tiles.  
Stack with your partner on the (inter)cardinal where there's no *Gorgons* and look away from the boss when they pop out from the ground. Then in each group, the player with the short duration <span class='speDebuff'>Eye of the Gorgon</span> will move to the *Gorgon* and petrify it while the other will drop their <span class='speDebuff'>Blood of the Gorgon</span> on the empty space. Once it's done, swap position with your partner and repeat the same thing:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="gorgo1.jpg;gorgo2.jpg;gorgo3.jpg" imgDesc="Look away from the boss;Player with short <span class='speDebuff'>Eye of the Gorgon</span> move to petrify their <em>Gorgon</em> and stay inside;Swap position with your partner" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then identify where *Hephaistos* 's clone is spawning, he will cast **Gorgospit** and kill 2 *Gorgons*. If the *Gorgons* are on cardinals, he will attack through the middle of the arena and leave 2 opposite *Gorgons* alive, otherwise he will attack one outer side of the arena and leave 2 adjacent *Gorgons* alive.  
Quickly regroup in light parties and move to your assigned and remaining *Gorgon*. The player with <span class='speDebuff'>Crown of the Gorgon</span> will move behind his *Gorgon* and the rest of his group will move in front of the *Gordon* with the <span class='speDebuff'>Breath of the Gorgon</span> stack:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'crownOpposite.jpg' }}'>

<u>If the remaining <em>Gorgons</em> are adjacent, everyone will be positioned on the line formed by the <em>Gorgons</em> as shown below:</u>
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'crownAdjacent.jpg' }}'>

___

If *Hephaistos* starts with *Hippo* mode, use your knockback immunity to dodge **Footprint** then he'll turn towards a random cardinal and cast **Quadrupedal Crush** or **Quadrupedal Impact**. If it's **Impact**, move where he's jumping and get knocked into the opposite side, otherwise move away from his destination.  

Then he'll cast **Conceptual Tetraflare/Diflare** and you need to remember which cast it is. And he will start **Blazing Footfalls** showing the first **Trailblaizer** and the following **Quadrupedal Crush** or **Quadrupedal Impact**. This **Quadrupedal** is always the opposite of the first one.  
Stand to the left or the right side to get knocked away to safe side for the incoming **Quadrupedal Crush/Impact**. You also have to form light parties or pairs for the **Conceptual Tetraflare/Diflare** that resolves right after the knockback.  
Once the stack is done, either stay away from the **Quadrupedal Crush** or move under to the boss destination for **Quadrupedal Impact** and get knocked towards the next safe spot:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="blaze1.jpg;blaze2.jpg;blaze3.jpg" imgDesc="Position yourself to dodge the next <strong>Quadrupedal Crush/Impact</strong> and in pairs for <strong>Tetraflare</strong> (or in light groups for <strong>Diflare</strong>);The <strong>Conceptual Tetraflare/Diflare</strong> resolves;Stay away from the boss destination" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

For the second **Trailblaizer**, get knocked to perform the next **Quadrupedal Crush/Impact** with ease. At that time, **Volcanic Torches** will start to draw a pattern. Once the **Trailblaizer** happens, the lines will change direction and show you the safe row/column.  
Then either stay away from the boss' **Quadrupedal Crush** and move into the safe area for **Volcanic Torches** or, use the incoming **Quadrupedal Impact** to get knocked into the safe area.
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="blaze4.jpg;blaze5.jpg;blaze6.jpg" imgDesc="Get kncoked to the safe side;Use the knockback to get into the safe area;Avoid the <strong>Volcanic Torches</strong> explosions" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

___

After the two forms, *Hephaistos* will conclude the fight with 2 **Genesis of Flame**, the second being the enrage. The boss needs to be under 50% HP so you can reach the second part of the fight.
