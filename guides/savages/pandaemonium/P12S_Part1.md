<h2><a id='ABDarkandLightDebuffs'>Dark And Light Debuffs</a></h2>
Through the fight, *Athena* will apply dark or light polarized debuff(s) and they all have a common point, a player will die if he's getting damaged by an attack from an element while having a debuff from the opposite element.  
Here is the list of all the debuffs:
  + <span class='speDebuff'>Astralbright/Umbralbright Soul</span>: when it resolves, drops a tower of the same element under the player, dealing small AoE <span class='magic'><u>dark/light</u> magical damage</span>. The tower must be soaked by a player with a debuff from the opposite element, dealing <span class='magic'>magical damage</span>. If not soaked, deals raid-wide <span class='magic'>magical damage</span> and applies a  <span class='debuff'>Damage Down</span> debuff.
+ <span class='speDebuff'>Astralstrong/Umbralstrong Soul</span>: *Athena* fires a laser of the same element toward the player. It's a line AoE that must be soaked by players with a debuff from the opposite element. Apply 
  + <span class='speDebuff'>Astral/Umbral Tilt</span>: kill the beared when hit by a attack from the same element.

*Athena* starts with **On the Soul** followed by **Paradeigma 1**.

Identify which side of the arena the *Anthropos* spawned and have the group except the Tanks move to the opposite side. Then on the adds side, one ranged DPS will move to the middle on the arena, one Tank will move at max melee range from the boss and the other Tank will stand between these two players.  
The first set of **White Flame** will happen, the middle Tank must use his invulnerability because he will receive 2 **White Flame** at once while the other Tank and the ranged DPS will get hit once.  
Then the ranged DPS will move back to the group while both Tanks will use their invulnerability to cancel the second set.

At the same time, *Athena* will prepare **Trinity of Souls**. Identify which sides are safes, for this cast the wings will alway glow from bot to top.

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="para1-1.jpg;para1-2.jpg;para1-3.jpg;para1-4.jpg" imgDesc="Dodge first <strong>Trinity</strong>;First <strong>White Flame</strong> happen;Dodge second <strong>Trinity</strong>;Dodge third <strong>Trinity</strong> and second <strong>White Flame</strong> happen at the same time" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

> There's an alternative way, where both Tanks use their invulnerability but the main Tank must mitigate the next auto attack since the <span class='debuff'>Magic Vulnerability Up</span> is still up.

Then **Paradeigma 2** is casted. The four adds on cardinals will tether to 2 Tanks/Healers and 2 DPS that must move away from their add to stretch the tether in a straight line and form a box around *Athena* with their tethers.  
Meanwhile, the players with <span class='speDebuff'>Astralbright/Umbralbright Soul</span> must drop a tower next to a tethered player of the opposite element. To do so, while looking at the North, Tanks/Healers will rotate clockwise to take the first available spot and DPS will rotate counter-clockwise.  
Once the towers are dropped, players who had the tethers soak the near tower and check the adds North to dodge their line AoE after. The two adds North cannot spawn next to each other.

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="para2-1.jpg;para2-2.jpg;para2-3.jpg;para2-4.jpg" imgDesc="Get in positions;Towers are dropped and <strong>Polarized Sear</strong> happens;Tether players soak the tower next to them;Dodge <strong>Ray of Light</strong> from the North adds" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Afterward, *Athena* will cast **On the Soul** followed by **Glaukopis**, swap Tanks during the cast.

Next is **Superchain theory 1**, regroup around the first orb either in or out and spread around or form pairs.  
Then move inside the adjacent **Superchain Coil** (blue donut) orb and form groups for <span class='speDebuff'>Astralstrong/Umbralstrong Soul</span>. Players with a Umbral debuff (light one) will group left while players with an Astral debuff (dark one) will group to the right. Player with <span class='speDebuff'>Umbralstrong Soul</span> debuffs will move with the left group and the <span class='speDebuff'>Astralstrong Soul</span> player with the right group.  
Finally move to the next corner and do a in/out or out/in based on the orbs order.  
Afterward, the <span class='speDebuff'>Heavensflame Soul</span> players will move away to not kill anyone with their explosion. The <span class='speDebuff'>Astralbright/Umbralbright Soul</span> players will drop their tower and the <span class='speDebuff'>Astralstrong/Umbralstrong Soul</span> players will soak them afterward.

*Athena* will perform another **Trinity of Souls** but the order for this one is random. It's followed by **Apodialogos/Peridialogos**, have the group moves in and the Tanks for the former and do the opposite for the latter. Then quickly heal for the incoming **On the Soul**.

> An easy way to remember is that for **Apodialogos**, the group must <u>A</u>dvance
