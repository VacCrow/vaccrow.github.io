*Pandæmonium* starts the fight with **Ultima**. It is followed by **Soul Grasp**, either share, solo Tank or use a Tank invulnerability.

Next *Pandæmonium* will cast **Dividing Wing** with **Steel Web**. The two tethered player must move in front of their sword tilted slightly toward the outside of the arena (check diagram below).  
The rest will stack in group, Tanks/Healers to the left and DPS to the right. Let the player with the stack marker stay middle to ensure that everyone has enough space to be inside the stack but not too close from each other.

<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'dividingWing1.jpg' }}'>

Right after, **Pandæmon's Circle/Holy** is casted, either move in for **Pandæmon's Circle** or move out for **Pandæmon's Holy**.

Soon after is **Wicked Step**, Tanks must be careful and must get knocked to the opposite side platform, aim for the North part of the platform. Then the Tanks, a random Healer and a random DPS will get **Entangling Web**. These AoEs need to overlap each other in order to create a bridge over the poison pool. The Healer will move to the left side while the DPS will move to the right side. Remember to dodge once **Entangling Web** is baited.

Once the bridge is created, everyone must move into their **Pandaemonic Pillars** tower. Tanks next to their bridge, Healer on the middle to the side, Melee DPS on the central front/middle ones and Ranged on the far back. Then dodge the incoming **Pandæmon's Circle/Holy** while dodging the *Pandaemonic Pillars* attack. The far row is always unsafe.

> An easy way to dodge is to stay at the left or right edge. If the **Pandaemonic Pillars* attack is a donut, move inside otherwise stay on the edge.

Immediately spread out for **Silkspit**, Melees on side platforms and Ranged in a + shape on the middle one:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'silk.jpg' }}'>

Once it resolves, **Dæmoniac Bonds** debuffs are applied, remember to check the order. Here it will always be <span class='speDebuff'>Dæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DaemoniacBonds }}'> with either <span class='speDebuff'>Duodæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DuodaemoniacBonds }}'> or <span class='speDebuff'>Tetradæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.TetradaemoniacBonds }}'>.  
At the same time, the boss will cast **Pandæmoniac Meltdown**, the line share should stay middle while the two marked players can move to the sides to bait the line AoE away.
As soon as it revoles, move to the left platform and the Tanks/Healers will work on the left edge and the DPS will work on the right edge. And based on your debuff timer, either stay spread, form a Tank/Healer DPS pair or form a Tanks/Healers group and a DPS group. Move again to resolve the second debuff:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="monoBonds.jpg;duoBonds.jpg;tetraBonds.jpg" imgDesc="Everyone spread;A Tank/Healer pairs with a DPS; All Tanks/Healers together and all DPS together" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Afterward move back middle and get ready for the incoming **Ultima** and **Soul Grasp**.

*Pandæmonium* will apply once again **Dæmoniac Bonds**, a combo of <span class='speDebuff'>Dæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DaemoniacBonds }}'> and <span class='speDebuff'>Duodæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DuodaemoniacBonds }}'> in a random order.

Once you get the debuff order, **Pandæmoniac Turrets** will appear. DPS will take the towers in the corners while the Tanks and Healers will take the inner ones. Once the towers are soaked the *Pandæmoniac Turrets* will spawn, showing off their number. Each role will always get in charged of the same number:
  Melee DPS (1) > Healers (2) > Ranged DPS (3) > Tanks (4)  
The *Pandæmoniac Turrets* will have two "patterns". Either there's 1, 2, 3 and 4 on each side, if we cut the arena in half vertically, so you can do the mechanic with your light party. Or the numbers are spread all over the arena, in that case the players from the left side will take the leftmost turret and vice-versa for the right side group.  
About Healers and DPS, when it's their turn, each player has to position themself in front of the turret and aim vertically to the opposite side of the arena, North or South. In the other cases, dodge the lasers.
However for Tanks, they have to soak every laser. When a Tank soak a laser, he must take care to not be the first player hit in order to not receive the <span class='debuff'>Dark Resistance Down II</span>. The last turrets will be soaked alone by the Tanks.

> Since the knockback angle is from the centre of the turret, the baiter can aim vertically and the Tank can aim to get push diagonally if it can helps. Be careful to not walk into or bait an adjacent laser while doing so.

Once every lasers are done, either spread or group in pairs to solve the **Dæmoniac Bonds** debuffs.

Then the boss head will move for **Pandæmoniac Ray**, step behind it and dodge the **Jade Passage** from the orbs that spawn after.

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase2'></a>

*Pandæmonium* will resume with **Ultima** followed by **Soul Grasp** and **Wicked Step**.

Once the Tanks are knocked, use **Entangle Web** to create bridges and spread for **Silkspit** as done before.  
While you're getting in position, the boss apply **Dæmoniac Bonds** debuffs with <span class='speDebuff'>Dæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DaemoniacBonds }}'> and <span class='speDebuff'>Tetradæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.TetradaemoniacBonds }}'>.

Move back middle to soak **Pandaemonic Pillars** towers. Then move in or out for **Pandæmon's Circle/Holy** and dodge the *Pandaemonic Pillars*' attacks.  
Immediately after, *Pandæmonium* will cast **Pandæmoniac Ray**. Move behind the head and spread or stack in groups for the first **Dæmoniac Bonds** debuff. Then dodge the orbs' **Jade Passage** and resolve the second **Dæmoniac Bonds** debuff at the same time.  

> You can use the same position from the first **Dæmoniac Bonds** to spread/stack.

*Pandæmonium* will follow up with **Dividing Wings** and **Steel Web** comboed with **Touchdown**.  
The Tanks and Healers will move to the left platform while the DPs will move to the right one to do their **Steel Web** shares. Players tethered with **Dividing Wings** must move to their sword and aim the cleave toward the outside.
Remember to free the players afterward.
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'dividingWing2.jpg' }}'>

Move back middle for **Pandæmoniac Meltdown** followed by **Soul Grasp**, resolve as previously.

*Pandæmonium* will start **Pandæmoniac Web**.  
**Dividing Wings** players will aim their cleave on East and West toward the outside. The three players with **Entangling Web** will move South and overlap their AoEs to link the left pillar to the right one thus creating a web wall between them. The three leftover players will stack for **Steel Web** slightly South of the **Dividing Wings**' swords. While everything happens, the boss will cast **Pandæmon's Holy** but everyone should already be safe from it.  
Quickly free the players from the stack since they will get the second set of **Entangling Web**, they must do the same thing but **<u>MUST NOT</u>** walk into the web wall or it will break. Standing slightly North the wall works and once the AoEs resolve, it will solidify the web wall for the next mechanic.
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="pandaWeb1.jpg;pandaWeb2.jpg" imgDesc="<strong>Dividing Wings</strong> East and West, <strong>Entangling Web</strong> line up South and <strong>Dividing Wings</strong> stack middle-ish;Second <strong>Entangling Web</strong> slightly North of the web wall" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

When the second **Entangling Web** resolve, *Pandæmonium* applies **Dæmoniac Bonds** with <span class='speDebuff'>Dæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DaemoniacBonds }}'> and <span class='speDebuff'>Duodæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DuodaemoniacBonds }}'>.  
Now it is time for **Harrowing Hell**. Regroup in front of the boss and get ready to mitigate. Since **Harrowing Hell** hits multiple times over 15s, be sure to use long duration mitigation or spread their usage over the attack. Tank LB can be used to nullify most of the damage for 8 seconds. Both Tanks must be the closest players to soak the "front damage".  
The last hit will knock away everyone into the web wall, stunning everyone. And before being knocked away, you can already preposition for the first debuff, pairs or spread.  
Once you can move move again quickly get in position for the first **Dæmoniac Bonds** debuff followed by the second.

Then **Ultima** wil be casted followed by the tank busters **Soul Grasp** and **Wicked Step**.

Once again use **Entangled Web** to retrieve the Tanks and get ready for **Parted Plumes**. Move into the last cone and once the first cone happens, move into it.  
At the same time, *Pandæmonium* will cast **Pandæmoniac Ray** so move behind its head while turning around **Parted Plumes**. Remember to dodge **Jade Passage** after.  
Then the boss will cast a random **Pandæmon's Circle/Holy** and its opposite, dodge in/out as necessary.

Spread once again over the arena for **Silkspit** and move back for **Pandaemonic Pillars**.  
Dodge the *Pandaemonic Pillars* along with the **Pandæmon's Circle/Holy**.  
Regroup mid for **Pandæmoniac Meltdown** followed by **Harrowing Hell** that acts as the enrage since there is no wall to save you.
