*Pandæmonium* starts the fight with **Ultima**. It is followed by **Soul Grasp**, either share, solo Tank or use a Tank invulnerability.

Next *Pandæmonium* will cast **Dividing Wing** with **Steel Web**. The two tethered player must move in front of their sword tilted slightly toward the outside of the arena (check diagram below).  
The rest will stack in group, Tanks/Healers to the left and DPS to the right. Let the player with the stack marker stay middle to ensure that everyone has enough space to be inside the stack but not too close from each other.

<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'dividingWeb.jpg' }}'>

Right after, **Pandæmon's Circle/Holy** is casted, either move in for **Pandæmon's Circle** or move out for **Pandæmon's Holy**.

Soon after is **Wicked Step**, Tanks must be careful and must get knocked to the opposite side platform, aim for the North part of the platform. Then the Tanks, a random Healer and a random DPS will get **Entangling Web**. These AoEs need to overlap each other in order to create a bridge over the poison pool. The Healer will move to the left side while the DPS will move to the right side. Remember to dodge once **Entangling Web** is baited.

Once the bridge is created, everyone must move into their **Pandaemonic Pillars** tower. Tanks next to their bridge, Healer on the middle to the side, Melee DPS on the central front/middle ones and Ranged on the far back. Then dodge the incoming **Pandæmon's Circle/Holy** while dodging the *Pandaemonic Pillars* attack. The far row is always unsafe.

> An easy way to dodge is to stay at the left or right edge. If the **Pandaemonic Pillars* attack is a donut, move inside otherwise stay on the edge.

Immediately spread out for **Silksplit**, Melees on side platforms and Ranged in a + shape on the middle one:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'silk.jpg' }}'>

Once it resolves, **Dæmoniac Bonds** debuffs are applied, remember to check the order. Here it will always be **Dæmoniac Bonds** <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DaemoniacBonds }}'> with either <span class='debuff'>Duodæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DuodaemoniacBonds }}'> or <span class='debuff'>Tetradæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.TetradaemoniacBonds }}'>.  
At the same time, the boss will cast **Pandæmoniac Meltdown**, the line share should stay middle while the two marked players can move to the sides to bait the line AoE away.
As soon as it revoles, move to the left platform and the Tanks/Healers will work on the left edge and the DPS will work on the right edge. And based on your debuff timer, either stay spread, form a Tank/Healer DPS pair or form a Tanks/Healers group and a DPS group. Move again to resolve the second debuff:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="monoBonds.jpg;duoBonds.jpg;tetraBonds.jpg" imgDesc="Everyone spread;A Tank/Healer pairs with a DPS; All Tanks/Healers together and all DPS together" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Afterward move back middle and get ready for the incoming **Ultima** and **Soul Grasp**.

*Pandæmonium* will apply once again **Dæmoniac Bonds**, a combo of **Dæmoniac Bonds** <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DaemoniacBonds }}'> and <span class='debuff'>Duodæmoniac Bonds</span> <img class='iconImg' src='{{ site.data.iconList.P10S.DuodaemoniacBonds }}'> in a random order.

Once you get the debuff order, **Pandæmoniac Turrets** will appear. DPS will take the towers in the corners while the Tanks and Healers will take the inner ones. Once the towers are soaked the *Pandæmoniac Turrets* will spawn, showing off their number. Each role will always get in charged of the same number:
  Melee DPS (1) > Healers (2) > Ranged DPS (3) > Tanks (4)  
The *Pandæmoniac Turrets* will have two "patterns". Either there's 1, 2, 3 and 4 on each side, if we cut the arena in half vertically, so you can do the mechanic with your light party. Or the numbers are spread all over the arena, in that case the players from the left side will take the leftmost turret and vice-versa for the right side group.  
About Healers and DPS, when it's their turn, each player has to position themself in front of the turret and aim vertically to the opposite side of the arena, North or South. In the other cases, dodge the lasers.
However for Tanks, they have to soak every laser. When a Tank soak a laser, he must take care to not be the first player hit in order to not receive the <span class='debuff'>Dark Resistance Down II</span>. The last turrets will be soaked alone by the Tanks.
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="turret1.jpg;turret2.jpg;turret3.jpg;turret4.jpg;turret5.jpg;turret6.jpg;turretSpe.jpg" imgDesc="Get in positions for the towers;Turrets spawn with their number (light party pattern here);1st turret;2nd turret;3rd turret;4th turret;Case when the whole arena must be used" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

> Since the knockback angle is from the centre of the turret, the baiter can aim vertically and the Tank can aim to get push diagonally if it can helps. Be careful to not walk into or bait an adjacent laser while doing so.
