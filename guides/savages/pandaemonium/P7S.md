The fight starts with **Spark of Life**, remember to mitigate them to reduce the damage from the <span class='debuff'>Bleed</span>. It is follow by a random **Condensed/Dispersed Aero II**, Tanks must either stack or spread for it. Use any invulnerability at your discretion.

Then *Agdistis* will cast **Blade of Altis** into **Immortal's Obol**. The front left or right of the arena will have 2 set of exaflares far away from each other, move there and once the arena layout changed, stay along the North edge to dodge the exaflares.

**Forbidden Fruit** will be cast, spawning 2 Birds on front platforms and 1 Io on a random front platform. Both Healers will be targeted by  **Hemitheos's Holy III** shares. Since the boss will also be casting **Bough of Altis** in the back, move on the platform will only 1 Bird, with one group on the North edge and the other on the South edge away from the Birds path. The South group must be careful about **Bough of Altis** that can hit them:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'fruit1.jpg' }}'>

Next is another random **Condensed/Dispersed Aero II** into **Spark of Life**.

The next cast, **Inviolate Bonds** will apply debuffs on player while the boss will cast **Bough of Altis** on the front platforms. Players with <span class='speDebuff'>Inviolate Winds</span> must spread around the South platform while the others stack in the middle with the <span class='speDebuff'>Holy Bonds</span> share. Then *Agdistis* will finish **Bough of Altis** and cleave two platforms, move into the safe platform and have the <span class='speDebuff'>Inviolate Winds II</span> spread around while the others stack middle with the <span class='speDebuff'>Holy Bonds II</span>:
{% assign slideCounter = 0 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="bonds1.jpg;bonds2.jpg" imgDesc="On South platform, <em>Inviolate Winds</em> spread around and <em>Holy Bonds</em> stack middle;Repeat the same thing on the safe platform with the roles swapped" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Agdistis* will destroy the front bridge with **Roots of Altis** and cast another **Condensed/Dispersed Aero II**.

Another **Forbidden Fruit** with 3 Birds, one on each platform. Everyone must spread for **Hemitheos's Holy** and stay out of the Birds' path. Use your knockback immunity to cancel **Multicast**.  
Here is an example of different positions:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'fruit2.jpg' }}'>

Quickly regroup in light party to the left and right front platforms before *Agdistis* destroys the remaining bridges with **Roots of Altis** and cast **Forbidden Fruit**, spawning 3 Io on each platforms. Each Healers will receive a **Hemitheos's Holy III** share and right before it resolves, a new bridge will appear allowing you to side step in to dodge the Io' AoE and do the share properly.

Then *Agdistis* will **Bough of Altis** at the front before cleaving two platforms, move to the safe one. Soon after a random wil be cast **Condensed/Dispersed Aero II**.

Next is another **Forbidden Fruit** spawning 2 Minotaurs with tethers on two platforms, 1 Io with 4 tethers on the remaining one and 1 Minotaur will spawn in the middle of the bridge. The players tethered to the Io must move behind him and spread to aim the line AoEs away from the arena. The players tether to a Minotaur will move to the platform where the other Minotaur is and stand behind. The two players without anything have to move close to the central Minotaur in order to bait the cleaves between the two Minotaurs platforms and give more space to the Io people:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'fruit3.jpg' }}'>

Then *Agdistis* will cast **Blade of Altis** along with **Multicast** and **Hemitheos's Holy III**. The arena will return to its original state. Group in light parties and stand near the middle, ready to get knocked away to the left and right, between the exaflares, with your group in order to share the damage. Don't forget to move where the exaflares started to dodge them.

Next is another random **Condensed/Dispersed Aero II**. Enjoy. :^)

The next **Forbidden Fruit** will spawn 4 Birds that will be tethered to four players, these players must use their knockback immunity and move to the opposite side of the arena. In the meantime, the other players have to move in the towers created by **Shadow of Altis** and soak them.

*Agdistis* wil cast another **Spark of Life** before casting **Immortal's Obol** reverting the arena to the three platforms layout.

It's time for another **Forbidden Fruit** this time with 1 Io and 2 Birds and **Inviolate Purgation** will place layers of debuffs on players. Everyone will move to the North West platform (if the Io is there then move to the North East platform).  
The <span class='speDebuff'>Holy Purgation</span> group will position themselves on the North West of the platform while the <span class='speDebuff'>Purgatory Winds</span> players will spread on the North, Middle, South, and South West of the platform. These position allow for full uptime and an easier time to heal everyone.  
Once the debuffs are done, move to the opposite front platform and repeat with mirrored positions. Repeat this for each ste of debuffs.  
Have a small stop between the second and third set in order to mitigate the heavy raid-wide **Light of Life**:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="purga1.jpg;purga2.jpg;purga3.jpg;purga4.jpg" imgDesc="With the Io South, <em>Holy Purgation</em> move North West and <em>Purgatory Winds</em> North East;<em>Purgatory Winds II</em> move South;<em>Purgatory Winds III</em> move North East;<em>Purgatory Winds IV</em> move South" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Next is another **Forbidden Fruit** with only 2 Birds in the middle of a platform, the group has to immediately move to the platform without any Birds before the bridges are broken by **Root of Altis**. Then the boss will cast **Hemitheos's Glare**, stand on the edge and once the first AoE is dropped, start to move toward the Bird that isn't facing you. New bridges will appear allowing you to move towards that platform and dodge the AoEs.

It's now time for the grand finale (no it's just three puzzles), starting with **Famine's Harvest**. 2 platforms will have 2 Minotaurs with tether and 1 Bird (slightly outside), the third platform will have 2 Minotaurs without tether.  
The players tethered to a Minotaur have to move to the opposite platform along the edge, behind the other Minotaurs with tether and they must cross the tethers.  
The players without tethers must move towards the Minotaurs to bait the cleave towards the outside and create a safe spot when the Birds dash. Check the diagram below for more precision:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="famine1.jpg;famine2.jpg" imgDesc="Tethered players move on the opposite platform, cross the tethers and stand on the edge. Other players bait their Minotaur;Prayge" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

It is immediately followed by **Death's Harvest**, where only the Io on a platform matters. <u>Identify this Io and consider him as South for the following positions.</u>  
Tanks has to use their invulnerability to survive and will stack together on the bridge next the Io platform that isn't cleaved by a bird. The rest will form two groups of 3 on the top left and right platform and get into fixed positions:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="death1.jpg;death2.jpg;death2bis.jpg" imgDesc="Put the platform Io South and move into these fixed positions. Tanks use their invulnerability;Tethers (and Tanks) go BAM;Example with the other pattern" slideNumber=slideCounter %}
For Healers and DPS, use the patterns (and the red lines) on the ground to go into the correct position:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'deathPos.jpg' }}'>

Now is the last one, **War's Harvest**, with 2 Birds on two platforms with tethers, 2 Minotaurs on bridges with tethers and 1 Io on the remaining platform with tethers. The players tethered to the Io will spread around him and aim towards the outside. The players tethered to a bird will move to the opposite bridge, and behind the minotaur if there's one. The players tethered to a Minotaur have to move to the edge of the next (counter) clockwise available platform:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="war1.jpg;war2.jpg" imgDesc="Spread around your Io, move on the bridge away from your Bird, move to the edge of the adjacent platform of your Minotaur;Go random bullshit" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Heal everyone and mitigate before the next **Spark of Life**.

Next is **Bough of Altis** on the front platforms with **Hemitheos's Holy III** on both Healers.

Finally, *Agdistis* will cast two **Spark of Life** in a row before casting his enrage **Light of Life**.
