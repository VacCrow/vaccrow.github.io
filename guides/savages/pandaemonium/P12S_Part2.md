The fight will start with **Ultima** followed by **Palladian Grasp**. The Tank targeted can stand alone on his side of the arena and use his invulnerability to trivialise the mechanic.

Right after, *Pallan Athena* will cast **Gaiaochos**, stack middle and mitigate as necessary. Once the arena has shrink, quickly check the adds to find the safe spots. When <span class='speDebuff'>Missing Link</span> is applied, DPS will move to the left safe spot while the Tanks/Healers will move to the right safe spot, breaking the chains at the same time.  
Then move back middle for **Geocentrism**. Wait for the tentacles to know **Geocentrism** will modify the ground AoEs and either spread around the centre **Demi Parthelion**, form a Melee and a Ranged horizontal line or form a Left/Right group vertical line. Check the diagrams bellow for fixed positions.  
While **Geocentrism** happens, **Divine Excoriation** will hit everyone so don't stack with anyone else.

*Pallan Athena* will cast another **Ultima**, bringing back the original arena. She will immediately pursue with **The Classical Concept**, heal and mitigate if needed.  
Once your receive your marker, move in pair to your assigned column/blue icosahedron based on your marker: <span style='color: MediumSeaGreen'>Triangle</span> > <span style='color: Tomato'>Circles</span> > <span style='color: dodgerblue'>Cross</span> > <span style='color: MediumPurple'>Square</span>.  
Then the <span class='speDebuff'>Alpha Target</span> player will get in position to block the tether from an adjacent red pyramid and <span class='speDebuff'>Beta Target</span> will block an adjacent yellow square. If you have to choose between two possibilities for your shape, check the first shape and if it has another adjacent blue icosahedron it means it's the wrong one and you have to pick the other shape.  
After the tethers have been block, move between the shapes to dodge **Implode**.  
Right after, the two blades will stab the floor and **Palladian Ray** must be baited. Pairs on the left side (<span style='color: MediumSeaGreen'>Triangle</span> and <span style='color: Tomato'>Circles</span> >) will bait the left blades while the pairs of the right side (<span style='color: dodgerblue'>Cross</span> > <span style='color: MediumPurple'>Square</span>) will bait the right blade. Be careful to not bait a cone toward the other group.

*Pallan Athena* will resume with another **Ultima** followed by **Crushing Helm**, remember to dispell the <span class='debuff'>Physical Vulnerability Up</span> debuff on the Tanks before the last hit.
