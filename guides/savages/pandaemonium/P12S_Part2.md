The fight will start with **Ultima** followed by **Palladian Grasp**. The Tank targeted can stand alone on his side of the arena and use his invulnerability to trivialise the mechanic.

Right after, *Pallan Athena* will cast **Gaiaochos**, stack middle and mitigate as necessary. Once the arena has shrink, quickly check the adds to find the safe spots. When <span class='speDebuff'>Missing Link</span> is applied, DPS will move to the left safe spot while the Tanks/Healers will move to the right safe spot, breaking the chains at the same time.  
Then move back middle for **Geocentrism**. Wait for the tentacles to know **Geocentrism** will modify the ground AoEs and either spread around the centre **Demi Parthelion**, form a Melee and a Ranged horizontal line or form a Left/Right group vertical line. Check the diagrams bellow for fixed positions.  
While **Geocentrism** happens, **Divine Excoriation** will hit everyone so don't stack with anyone else.

*Pallan Athena* will cast another **Ultima**, bringing back the original arena. She will immediately pursue with **The Classical Concept**, heal and mitigate if needed.  
Once your receive your marker, move in pair to your assigned column/blue icosahedron based on your marker: <span style='color: MediumSeaGreen'>Triangle</span> > <span style='color: Tomato'>Circles</span> > <span style='color: dodgerblue'>Cross</span> > <span style='color: MediumPurple'>Square</span>.  
Then the <span class='speDebuff'>Alpha Target</span> player will get in position to block the tether from an adjacent red pyramid and <span class='speDebuff'>Beta Target</span> will block an adjacent yellow square. If you have to choose between two possibilities for your shape, check the first shape and if it has another adjacent blue icosahedron it means it's the wrong one and you have to pick the other shape.  
After the tethers have been block, move between the shapes to dodge **Implode**.  
Right after, the two blades will stab the floor and **Palladian Ray** must be baited. Pairs on the left side (<span style='color: MediumSeaGreen'>Triangle</span> and <span style='color: Tomato'>Circles</span>) will bait the left blades while the pairs of the right side (<span style='color: dodgerblue'>Cross</span> > <span style='color: MediumPurple'>Square</span>) will bait the right blade. Be careful to not bait a cone toward the other group.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="concept1-1.jpg;concept1-2.jpg;concept1-3.jpg;concept1-4.jpg" imgDesc="Move in pair to your assigned position;Block your shape: alpha for red triangle, beta for yellow square;Dodge <strong>Implode<strong>;Bait <strong>Palladian Ray</strong> and move out" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Pallan Athena* will resume with another **Ultima** followed by **Crushing Helm**, remember to dispell the <span class='debuff'>Physical Vulnerability Up</span> debuff on the Tanks before the last hit.  
During this tank buster, everyone can get in their fixed position for the next mechanic, check the diagram below.

Now it's time for **Caloric Theory**. When the cast starts, one DPS and Tank/Healer will receive the fire marker. These two players and the Tanks middle must swap their position. Have one Tank scanning counter-clockwise from North and the other Tank clockwise from North-West. Don't forget to use some mitigation to cover **Caloric Theory** and the share that happen at the same time.  
Then the outer <span class='speDebuff'>Atmosfaction</span> will form a pair with the next clockwise <span class='speDebuff'>Pyrefaction</span> player, if it's impossible pair up with the next counter-clockwise <span class='speDebuff'>Pyrefaction</span> player. Then the middle DPS will pair with a free <span class='speDebuff'>Pyrefaction</span> player and finally the middle Tank/Healer will complete the last pair.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="calo1-1.jpg;calo1-2.jpg;calo1-3.jpg;calo1-4.jpg;calo1-5.jpg;calo1-6.jpg" imgDesc="Get to your static position and wait for getting the fire marker;Marked players move mid and Tank(s) replace them;Debuffs are assigned;Outer wind debuff move to the next clockwise fire player (or counter-clockwise if impossible);Middle players pair with remaining pyrefaction players;Debuffs resolve" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Then two <span class='speDebuff'>Pyrefaction</span> players will receive another <span class='speDebuff'>Pyrefaction</span> debuff.  
These two players will move diagonally to the outside so they can pair with someone from the next clockwise group. If there's the another <span class='speDebuff'>Pyrefaction</span>, go check the other way.  
Once they are in position, the player with debuff will pair with the closest <span class='speDebuff'>Pyrefaction</span> player.

{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="calo1-7.jpg;calo1-8.jpg;calo1-9.jpg;calo1-10.jpg" imgDesc="Debuffs are assigned;Pyrefaction players move out to pair with the next clockwise non-atmosfaction player (or counter-clockwise if impossible);Players without debuff rejoin their partner;Debuffs resolve" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Afterward, **Ekpyrosis** will be casted, spawning exaflares on North/South edges or the East/West edges on the arena.  
Based on where exaflares spawn, form Left/Right groups ou Melee/Ranged groups and move next to the exaflares so you're far from the proximity AoEs.  
Once the first set of exaflares starts moving, quickly spread along that edge to avoid cliping other player with **Ekpyrosis** AoE that drop on everyone.  
Finally, move to where the first exaflares where to dodge the passage of the exaflares from the opposite side.
