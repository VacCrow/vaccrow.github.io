<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase1'></a>

*Phoinix* will start the fight with **Scorched Exaltation**.

The group should stack behind the boss for **Heat of Condemnation** so it is easier for Tanks to grab their tethers.

Then the group have to move middle during the cast of **Experimental Fireplume**. If *Phoinix* use one orb, it will be baited in the middle so move away from the boss. Otherwise, if he uses 8 orbs, follow the AoEs and move away from the middle to avoid the last one.  
He will use **Left/Right Cinderwing** right after so remember to move accordingly.

*Phoinix* will then cast **Darkened Fire**. Form Tank/Healer and DPS pairs in the inner square at intercardinal position, standing in the small yellow squares is fine (check the diagram below). Once the *Darkened Fire* spawned, spread a bit to see the number assigned by **Brightened Fire** and move to the corresponding position in order to remove every stacks from the adds (players at then same position can stack with each other):
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'darkenedFire.jpg' }}'>

Right after the group has to stack behind the boss to help the Tanks get their **Heat of Condemnation** tether. This is followed by an another **Scorched Exaltation**

Soon afterward, *Phoinix* will cast **Devouring Brand** into **Experimental Fireplume**. Stack middle as a group and move into a safe quadrant when **Experimental Fireplume** cast is over. Take care about **Devouring Brand** explosion!

Once **Devouring Brand** has exploded, *Phoinix* will use **Searing Breeze**, so stack as much as possible to bait the AoEs in one spot then move to his left or right for **Left/Right Cinderwing**.

Stack middle to allow the Tanks to grab their **Heat of Condemnation** tethers and *Phoinix* will use **Experimental Fireplume** right after.

In the middle of **Experimental Fireplume** attack, *Phoinix* will cast **Trail of Condemnation** and leave the arena. Either split in two to the sides and spread or form a line and stack in pairs:

{% include slideshow.html imgLink="trail1Head.jpg;trail2Head.jpg" imgDesc="Middle head fires;Side heads fire" slideNumber=slideCounter %}
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SAdds'></a>

*Phoinix* will come back in the middle of the arena untargetable. Then four *Sunbirds* add will spawn. Have one Tank take the North and West one and the other Tank the remaining ones. Adds must be killed along the edge on a different cardinal for each add.

Then *Phoinix* will cast **Flames of Undeath**, resurrecting them into bigger version that will immediately cast **Fireglide Sweep**. Players tethered to a *Sunbird* must move to the opposite site. And the other players must move to the opposite side of the player they are tethered with. The result should be, one Tank/Healer and one DPS surrounding each *Sunbird*:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'adds1.jpg' }}'>

Then the *Sunbirds* will dash. Once a player get dashed in, take a side step to get out of the *Sunbird* path for the second dash. Don't forget to damage them as much as possible but don't kill them yet:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="adds2.jpg;adds3.jpg" imgDesc="Take a side step out after the second dash;Don't stand too close of the players who get dashed in" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

*Sunbirds* will move back to their respective Tanks since they keep aggro. Kill them on cardinal as previously done. Once dead, *Phoinix* will cast **Flames of Undeath**, filling his gauge if their bodies are too close from each other.

He will then become targetable and cast **Dead Rebirth**, mitigate appropriately.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase2'></a>

This phase will start with **Heat of Condemnation**, stack and grab the tethers as usual.

*Phoinix* will cast **Fledgling Flight** and the *Sparkfledged* will appear on top of 4 players, these players have to place them on the edge of the inner square, facing outside, on cardinals. Once placed, everyone should move in to avoid **Ashen Eye**:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'fledgling.jpg' }}'>

Stack mid after for **Experimental Gloryplume**. The **Experimental Fireplume** part is always 8 orbs here, and the **Experimental Ashplume** is random. Base on the initial explosion, split into 2 groups, Tanks/Melees on one side and Healer/Ranged on the other, then either stack or spread when the middle explosion happens.  
Example with 1 orb for the **Experimental Ashplume** part:  
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="gloryP1.jpg;gloryP2.jpg;gloryP3.jpg;gloryP4.jpg;gloryP5.jpg" imgDesc="Identify where you're going on the first explosion;Start moving;Step into the second explosion;Stack properly;The stack happen right after the last explosion" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Regroup to heal everyone and get ready for **Fountain of Fire**. During the cast, let the Tanks being the closest to the boss since the first **Sun's Pinion** bait is immediate:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'fount1.jpg' }}'>

When the first Fountains appear, the Healers must move into them, on their respective sides, ready to soak them. Healers must heal themselves after each soak.  
Meanwhile the rest of the group will split in 3 to bait the **Sun's Pinion** AoEs, Tanks, Melees and Ranged in this order. Everyone should be outside *Phoinix*' hitbox except the baiters who should be inside.  
When a player gets his **Sun's Pinion**, he will place it in front of the Fountain of their respective healer. The Tanks will place their AoEs in front of the first Fountains, Melees in front of the seconds and Ranged in front of the third. When a player *Sunshadow* appears, he has to wait half a second for the previous *Sunshadows* to dash then move across the arena to stand behind the opposite *Sunshadow* and wait here for his dash:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="fount2.jpg;fount3.jpg;fount4.jpg;fount5.jpg;fount6.jpg;fount7.jpg;fount8.jpg;fount9.jpg" imgDesc="Watch the first fountains to find your positions;Tanks move out and Melees move in;Melees get their <strong>Sun's Pinion</strong>;Melees move back, Ranged move in;Tanks swap positions, Ranged get their <strong>Sun's Pinion</strong>;1st dash happens, Melees swap positions, Ranged move out;2nd dash happens;Ranged swap positions" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

After the last Fountains, regroup mid to heal and shield everyone with the <span class='debuff'>Trickle of Fire</span> debuff for the two incoming **Scorched Exaltation** followed by **Heat of Condemnation**.

*Phoinix* will then cast **Firestorms of Asphodelos**. Heal everyone for **Flames of Asphodelos** into **Experimental Ashplume**, dodge the cones then either spread around the boss or stack in Melees and Ranged groups.

Afterward **Flames of Asphodelos** will be casted again but with **Storms of Asphodelos** this time. Dodge the cones again and have two ranged DPS and a Healer bait the Tornadoes cones toward the outside, the Tanks must grab the tethers and move South outside the hitbox while the remaining Healer and the two Melees move inside the boss' hitbox to bait the cones toward the East, West and North East/West (based on where the other Healer is).  
If both Tanks have their invulnerability, they can grab the tethers and move South inside the boss' hitbox and use them, one ranged will bait the North Tornado toward the outside and the rest of group stack North-ish at max melee range, on the opposite side of the ranged DPS:
{% assign slideCounter = slideCounter | plus: 1 %}
{% include slideshow.html imgLink="stormAsphoLegit.jpg;stormAsphoInvul.jpg" imgDesc="'Classic' strategy;Strategy using Tanks' invulnerability" slideNumber=slideCounter %}

Next is **Darkblaze Twister** into **Experimental Ashplume**, regroup in front of the black tethered Tornado and rotate clockwise around *Phoinix* to bait the 4 **Searing Breeze**. Then move back to the black Tornado, get knockback away and stack into the Tornadoes' AoE in group, Melees on one and Ranged on the other. Then stay stack or spread based on **Experimental Ashplume** pattern.

Quickly regroup and heal for the incoming **Scorched Exaltation**.
</div>

<div class='guideSection' markdown='1'>
<a id='SPhase3'></a>

The arena will go back to normal and *Phoinix* will cast **Death's Toll** into **Fledgling Flight**. The *Sparkfledged* will appear on top of 4 players, these players have to place them on the edge of the inner square, facing the middle of the arena, on cardinals. Once placed, to remove their stacks, players must be hit by **Ashen Eye**. The players with 1 stack will move behind a *Sparkfiledged* on a cardinal, players with 2 stacks will move at an intercardinal and the players with 4 stacks will stay middle:
<img class='soloImg' src='{{ page.imagePath | append: 'deathToll.jpg' }}'>

Immediately move middle once all **Ashen Eye** are done to get healed for **Life’s Agonies**. Use Healer LB if heals aren't fast enough in order to survive.
