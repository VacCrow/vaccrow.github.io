Hello there, I'm VacCrow (Kara Vac'crow @ Odin). I made these guides for my static, the Communist Seals, with their help. Our group *politic* is "a clear is a clear". Meaning that we're trying to perform well during the fights but if someone played poorly during the clear pull, he just sucks it up and will try next time. No log runs or whatsoever
Furthermore, we often go in blind and come up with our own strategies, adapted to our group composition. 

Therefore, the guides here reflect this idea and it means that some strategies described here are maybe non-optimal, may be sightly or completly different compare to your usual party finder strategy. The main goal of the guides is to understand what's happening because if you know how a mechanic works, it becomes easy to solve it. Well, that's my opinion /shrug

You can contact me through Discord (Vaccrow#3925) if you ever spot a poor explanation, a mistake or had a bug. Don't bother contacting me to tell me that a better strategy for a mechanic exists because I won't change it. If there is any, I may remplace them as I progress through the tier/fight.

Have fun :>
